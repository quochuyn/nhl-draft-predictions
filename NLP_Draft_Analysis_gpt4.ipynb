            "corpus first 5: [\" has all the assets you're looking for in a top nhl forward. he's a 6-foot-4 winger who can beat opponents with speed and skill. he possesses outstanding puck skills and can put pucks through legs and sticks at a very high rate. can use finesse, or power and quickness to get around defenders. can also set up and finish plays well. physically, he won't run over guys but his compete is good enough. he projects as a top-line winger with the potential to pop and become a true star in the nhl. is one of the draft's most tantalizing prospects, with a skill-size combo that scouts and coaches clamour for and he has already demonstrated against pro competition domestically and, more notably, internationally. it has been a big year for him. nine points in five games and a historic silver medal for the slovaks at the hlinka gretzky cup. an olympic bronze medal as the tournament's mvp. a silver medal with his club team, tps. a team-leading nine points at the men's worlds. is built like a power forward, with a 218-pound frame that makes him one of the draft's heaviest players, but he plays the game with uncharacteristic finesse, regularly flashing hands you'd expect out of a smaller player one-on-one to pull pucks in tight to his feet. he's also got a rangy, fluid stride, which makes him a surprisingly dangerous rush player — and impressive confidence with the puck on his stick, which enables him to hang onto it (sometimes to a fault) and attack off the wall into the slot (he loves taking the puck from the half wall to the home plate area to shoot from his forehand. the team that drafts him will be betting on his upside, which grades at or near the very top of this class. i'm also a big fan of his approach. he has continued to play his style and look to attack in control (a lot of forwards his size become more deferential and fall back into give-and-go habits to fit a mould when they make the jump to the pro level) as he has played against higher and higher competition. there is, despite his makeup and success, some risk associated with his projection at his size (small players aren't the only ones who carry size-based limitations with them!) though, and that, combined with how much i like the four players i have slotted ahead of him here, does leave me a little lower on him than where he'll be picked, even if there's a real chance he becomes one of the two or three best players out of this draft. can be a menace at the nhl level. his stick-handling reach and his play on the cycle makes him a threat down low. if he can broaden his game by working on his long range shot, that allows him to become a dual threat. but, even if he doesn't become that dual threat offensively, he has the physicality and the reach to net pucks in puck battles and set up teammates in the slot. with that said, i can envision him being a top six contributor at the nhl level. the potential of what can be as he continues on in his is intoxicating. a 6-foot-4 winger with physicality, high-end skill and one of the better overall shots in this draft, it's hard not to get excited. there is a chance that he ends up being the no. 1 pick in this draft and may one day be viewed as its best player. he's every bit as good as the other two players listed ahead of him on talent alone. i've watched a lot this year and while i am enamored with the physical tools and skills, there's not a ton of precedent for the kind of season he had, where he produced at a rate far below expectations of a top-five nhl draft pick in his league season yet was off the charts internationally. in the end, the largest sample we have to judge is that from his club season with tps. you look at players from the that have gone early in drafts and all of them had better numbers than , and many of them had better numbers by a lot. it's not something that is easily ignored. among u18 players who have played at least 20 games in the as u18 players, 0.32 points per game ranks 35th and 21st overall in the last 10 years. is a classic eye-test darling and that's a big reason why i have him in this range. if he hadn't played so well in those international events, i'm not sure we're having this discussion at all. but he did play in those games and we got to see a physically dominant young player who held his own against pros and eventually became one of his team's most important players. the olympics and world championship fields were not nhl-caliber competition, but they were significant stages on which broke out against professionals. i also think his progression over the season and playing with confidence down the stretch significantly altered how well he played for the better. this is a tough case to read, because we have a body of work that suggests he's statistically not among top-tier players in his own league historically, but we have this immense skillset that is so unique in this draft class that it's impossible to overlook. i think is in the mix with cooley and wright to be the best players in this class, and even though i know what the numbers say, i can't get past the incredible ceiling i believe his size-and-skill package creates. is one of the largest players in the first round and also possesses the largest upside of anyone in the class. a rocket of a shot, soft hands, and an improving skating stride all packaged into a 6-foot-4, 220-pound frame. his ability to make plays in space is great, but he'll need to do it without that time as well. he could be a unicorn. nothing brought out draft year best quite like the opportunity to wear his country's colours and represent in international competition. he's the ultimate patriot. started the scouting season off as if shot from a cannon, putting up nine points in five games en route to a silver medal at the hlinka-gretzky in august. next up, seven goals in seven games and mvp honours as he led to the bronze medal at the beijing olympics. then, lastly, a point a game clip at the world hockey championships in all this in his age-17 season. it's not like he was chopped liver in the either. ten points in 31 games is hardly anything to scoff at from a first-time draft-eligible skater in one of europe's more challenging professional leagues, after all. the appeal with is obvious: he's a 6-foot-4 playmaking power forward with soft hands, shooting skill, and the sort of wall game that would already rate as an above-average quality in the nhl. the first thing you notice is just how easily he retains possession under duress. it's like watching a bully play keep away, one hand stiff-arming his victim out of reach and the other one waving their stolen item to mock them for good measure. if wants the puck, then he takes the puck, and good luck getting it back. that we've mostly seen this from the slovak winger in professional settings this season just makes it that much more impressive. it's one thing to ward off physically undeveloped 17-year-olds in the whl; it's another thing entirely to swat away seasoned veterans in top men's league like they're mosquitos. brings a lot more to the table than just brute force, though. what makes him a unique prospect is how he turns those extended possession sequences into legitimate scoring chances. sometimes, it's a drive to the net-front for a chance of his own; other times, he'll handle his way into a passing opportunity and send the puck to his linemate to finish the job. where often leaves our staff wanting, though, is with his footspeed. the deficiencies are many, whether it's his posture, a heel kick out of recoveries, or a hop in his crossovers. he just cannot separate from opponents in space. to credit, we've already seen considerable growth from him as a skater this season, and there isn't any reason to believe he won't continue on that path as he rises up the ranks. it's probably an about-average tool at this point, which is a pretty big step up on where he started the season. don't be surprised if you hear name called as high as first overall in july's draft. players with his skill set are so rare. teams guard these players closely when they have them, and they move heaven and earth to find one when they don't. i mean, who wouldn't want a high-scoring top-six winger with a physical side? that's the upside with . dominated the international scene this past season, solidifying himself as my number two pick in the nhl draft this season. over the last year, played at the world juniors, the olympics, and world championships. his most dominating performance came at the olympics, where he led to a bronze medal and received mvp honors, a remarkable feat for an 18-year-old. is an intriguing prospect with an absurd overall physical and offensive package. at 6'4 and well over 200 pounds, is strong on the puck and uses his frame in a physical manner. yet, he has incredible hands and can make plays in-tight like few players can in this draft class. this is what makes so unique. he's a player with size and high skill that can dominate down-low or in open ice. while he dominated at the international level against men, struggled to put up points at times in top league. however, scouts aren't too concerned and believe higher numbers will come with time. may make the jump to the nhl immediately next season due to his physical maturity but will likely need at least another season of to further his offensive game. drives offense from the wing. he's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. he can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size. using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. while he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. with strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. on-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. he also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. he has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. his unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the nhl level. he is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. if he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt will be a force at the nhl for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. if he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly.\", \" is a very well-rounded who has no noticeable flaw in his skill set but there also isn't a ton about his game that gets you overly excited. he can skate and handle the puck like an nhler. game translates because of his compete and direct style of play. he takes pucks to the net and plays quick. he can pull up to make a tough pass but can take pucks to the interior too. he has the high-end vision to run a power-play unit and make tough plays with pace. his shot is very good, showing the ability to pick corners from long range consistently. off the puck he's competitive and responsible, showing maturity beyond his years. he projects as a no. 1 in the nhl due to his all-around play with a chance to be a star, but probably won't be an elite scorer in the league. still my top prospect in this class (though no longer in a tier of his own), is an athletic kid who boasts a wide gait and boxy shoulders that balance him over pucks. those physical tools are complemented by a lethal wrist shot release (which he can get off from several stances and pops off of his blade's heel or toe) and quick hands in traffic that allow him to take pucks off of the wall and create scoring chances to the interior. he's also one of the most diligent three-zone players in the draft, with a powerful stride that helps him push play up ice (though its power is more evident the length of the sheet than from a standstill into a quick foot race) when he's done providing support low in his zone or above the puck. while his shot is his biggest weapon inside the offensive zone (i actually think he was owed a few more goals than his 35 on 290 shots this season gave him), he played a much more creative game inside the offensive zone into the second half. he blends versatile skill with a heady, detailed game that will allow him to drive a line and be relied upon in all situations down the middle at the next level. there are times when scouts want to see him play with a little more fire and feistiness to really take over games and impose himself on the forecheck/in battles more, but his eye for detail off the puck puts him in a supportive role more often than an active chase and that's fine. i would have liked to see him hang onto the puck a little more this season, but he played with talented linemates where his ability to play into their strengths and execute off of give-and-go's worked. he's got pro tools and projects as an impactful top-six centre. he may not become a point per game player, but i see 30-goal, 70-point upside at a premium position. the complicated and essential question to answer is, “what does this all mean looking forward?” there is no doubt that attention to detail style of play combined with intelligent and quick decision-making is the start of a valuable foundation for him to continue to build on as he progresses into the nhl. however, that package of skills and habits will only take him so far when he advances to play against more intelligent and faster competition. in the he infrequently shows off his high octane offense, which reasonably has caused doubts about his offensive ceiling. at this moment in time, it is likely premature to value these concerns heavily enough to knock him off the top spot in the 2022 draft class. however, if these question marks around his offensive contributions still exist in july, it would be warranted to consider how his game will project to the nhl and if that assessment leads to a consensus 1st overall player. the expectation for (or any prospect for that matter) should not be to save the franchise or to be a generational talent, as he will most likely disappoint. a reasonable projection for would be in the range of a low-end 1st line to a high-end 2nd line which to some may sound pessimistic in the context of 1st overall. still, it is an essential piece to have on a successful team and is not easy to acquire. in addition, will likely benefit from being paired with skilled wingers, who can allow to focus on pushing play up ice to the offensive zone where his linemates can flourish. finally, with his shot, he will surely be a continual threat on the powerplay, where he has consistently shown he can score from many angles and distances. with high-end hockey sense highlighted by his tremendous offensive intelligence, can make a lot of plays. while he lacks a dynamic puck skills in terms of handling, he has one of the better shots in this draft class with a quick, deceptive release. though he has often been compared to patrice bergeron, i think is a good two-way player but not to the degree where that is an especially apt comparison. he does a lot of the things you hope a does in terms of puck possession, making plays and contributing in his own end. the offensive elements of his game are the standout traits for me. my biggest concern with to date is the general lack of progression in his game year over year, with the full knowledge that he missed an entire season. while i think he should be graded on a curve as a result, it is harder to know just how much that lost season impacted his long-term projection. hockey sense is a separating factor from most of his peers and he clearly has that competitive drive that allow him to win a lot of battles. in the end, i think does just about everything well. his hockey sense and his shot are high-end-to-elite traits, he has terrific vision and spots plays with the best of them, but the lack of a dynamic element to his play is what gives me the most concern aside from his progression. i have been waiting all season to see a player who looks like he should be a no. 1 nhl draft pick, and i did not feel his ceiling is at the same level as slafkovsky's or cooley's. is the safer pick of all three in that i think he has the highest floor of any of those three players and possesses an nhl-ready game. i don't think he's done developing and there's plenty of potential for him to still reach for, but my concern is that he's closer to plateauing than the other two players. i'm not convinced that's true yet, but it's definitely in the back of my mind as i rank these players because, to me, all three are very close. the top player from the class held this position from tip to tail on my board. is a highly intelligent pivot who boasts a heavy release, deft passing touch, and the wherewithal to package those tools into their situations. he lacks the separation speed you'd like from an elite centre but makes up for it with his nuanced understanding of the game. can connect plays, drive action, dish it or finish it, and thwart plays against. he's going to be good. in a draft year shaped by substantial depth rather than overwhelming star power, it's almost fitting that the least exciting option at first overall is the one. better still, the one, if you'll allow us that clunky pun. that would end up in that spot may have seemed like a foregone conclusion a year or two ago, but the gap year that the lost 2020-21 season forced on (and countless others) him slow out of the gates. two months of good-not-great production was enough to make the question of the first overall pick an open one for many in the industry, with new answers emerging first in the form of logan cooley and then later in juraj slafkovsky. in time, though, reminded the scouting community of his quality, ending many (not all…) of those conversa-tions emphatically. the 1.15 point per game clip that he ran through october and november turned to 1.36 by the end of the calendar year. from there, it just kept climbing until had amassed 94 points in 63 regular season contests by the season's end, good for a 1.49 point per game clip. it's still the lowest draft year points per game mark of any first overall pick out of the this side of rick nash in 2001, but a more selective and perhaps representative sample from december onward gets to 1.63 points per game. that's more than nico hischier in 2017 and ryan nugent-hopkins in 2011, for context. shifting our focus from the question of how many to how, is this draft's premier play-connector; an on-ice ad-ministrator through which his team's offensive and defensive sequences flow. by constantly surveying the ice, maintains a mental map of his surroundings with a downright topographical level of detail. he knows the position of his teammates like they're a long-established fact rather than a dynamic, changing set of options on the playing field, and moves the puck to them with a matching level of confidence. look-off passes, the give-and-go, one- and two-touch passes, reach-adjusted passing -- mastered every one of these tools en route to becoming one of the game's best playmaking centres not currently in the nhl. his cunning as a distributor with a high-level shot (even if it's a little peculiar from a mechanical perspective) that's especially potent off of the pass and some of the best hands in the class. he's the complete package offensively. we would, of course, feel better about shot if he used it a little more judiciously rather than settling for low percentage attempts under pressure, but that's a minor quibble for as scalable an offensive toolkit as you'll find in this class. then there's his play in the defensive zone. de-fensive reads, angles, and support play are beyond reproach. there may not be an art ross in his future, but the frank j. selke seems well within reach. we don't make the patrice bergeron comparison lightly, after all. all of these factors combined to make the consensus first overall pick for the elite prospects scouting staff. you just don't come across many players this polished or this well-rounded at 18-years-old, and that's too much to pass up on if you're holding the first pick in this july's draft. has been on the radar of scouts for a long-time now. he received exceptional status to play in the as a 15-year-old and put up amazing numbers at the time. unfortunately, he did not play last season because of covid restrictions in ontario. despite the missed time, captained to an under-18 gold medal in 2021 and put up 94 points this season. is potentially the most well-rounded player in the draft. he does everything really well, in all zones. he plays a mature game and has strong leadership qualities. originally looked like more of a goal-scorer in his 15-year-old season, but he has rounded out his playmaking as well in the past year or so. he finished top 10 in scoring. biggest asset is his shot and his ability to generate scoring opportunities. he can drive a line on his own, making him a potential number one at the nhl level. some scouts question his offensive ceiling for a potential number one pick, but he could easily put up 30 goals and 70 points at the nhl level with regularity. should jump into full-time nhl duty next season. is an elite two-way with incredible offensive ability. it's not often you watch players where you really struggle to find too many weaknesses at this level, but he has been that way for a while now. his intelligence on the ice is second-to-none and on full display in his playmaking, his lane pursuit, and his awareness. adds a pro caliber shot to his toolbox that will allow him to be a multi-dimensional offensive threat at the nhl level, sooner rather than later. he's so mature in his defensive game and because of that, he is just as effective defensively as he is offensively. he knows the nuances of playing the position and can properly support his defenders on every play. he never seems to be caught out of position and remains engaged and effective on both the rush and the cycle. the biggest issue with game this season was his inconsistent offensive production. through the christmas break, he wasn't producing the way a top-tier draft eligible prospect would in the but he put most of the questions about his production to rest with his amazing second-half explosion. there was an odd amount of discourse surrounding stature as the top player in this class given the way his season went. while it wasn't completely unwarranted, it is important to remember he missed essentially the entire 2020-21 season due to the pandemic, and had insane expectations coming off his rookie season. the way rebounded in the latter half of the year showed enough to remind people why he can be a future top-line in the nhl for years to come and why he is considered the odds-on favorite to be the number one selection in the nhl draft.\", \" is a very well-rounded defenseman. his puck game is great. he has the high-end brain to make a lot of tough plays often. can hit seams, make plays under pressure and makes a great outlet pass. he also shows individual skill which, when combined with good speed, allows him to be dangerous in transition too. defensively he's solid due to his skating, compete and brain, even though he's not imposing physically and can be trusted with tough responsibilities. projects as a top-pair defenseman. this kid turned 18 in the middle of february and he's already registered 65 points in 112 games at a professional level as a defenceman! statistical profile is as strong as any draft-eligible defenceman we've seen in recent years — and stronger than any player in this draft class. a poll of nhl scouts still gives czech defenceman david jiricek the slight edge, but i'd argue only further stamped what i believe to be the better case with his exceptional, record-setting play in nitra's playoff run and into the men's world championships. this is a kid who has looked a class above his peers whenever he's played with them, has excelled against nhlers on the senior stage, and is already a top player at his position in his top domestic league (albeit a difficult one to evaluate). is a calculated and poised three-zone defender who is capable of organizing play from the top of the zone, executing through seams in coverage at a high level, and starting and leading his fair share of rushes. he's got great edges and four-way mobility. and he also regularly flashes sneaky deception, which blends beautifully with his rare maturity for his age. though i wouldn't say he's a dynamic, game-breaking type offensively, i see plenty of calmness and talent, he knows when and how to push (and when and how to sit back and defend), he's already got pro size, he plays a polished game, and he's a righty. i expect him to become the best defenceman out of since zdeno chara and a true no. 2 (and maybe even no. 1) guy who plays an effective, efficient, play-driving modern game. the game just comes easy to him. with , you are netting a top pairing defender. while some of the report might scream that he is stronger offensively than he is defensively, he is well-rounded and well-adversed to defending the rush and neutralizing threats in his own zone. one of the very best passers in this draft, racked up a ton of assists this season with high-level vision and decisiveness with the puck on his stick. he finished with 26 points in 39 games in top pro league. the only u18 players to produce at a higher level at the same age as were forwards marian hossa and marian gaborik. and that was just the regular season. in the playoffs this year, had 17 points over the 19 games, by far a record in the league for a u18 player, though marian hossa's 1.43 points per game in the 1997 postseason will remain the high-water mark on a per-game rate. what did this year is largely unprecedented for a u18 defenseman. is clearly an intelligent offensive defenseman who defends at an average level. he is best with the puck on his stick, pushing pucks up ice and making plays. the offensive toolkit and offensive sense he possesses is clearly advanced for his age. his skating is at a high enough level and i think his overall hockey sense puts him among the top tier in this draft. that said, i think there are some limitations to his defensive game and there is a lot more he has to do to get detail in his game. he had a full green light it seemed at nitra, which is incredible confidence in a young guy, but we also got to see how often that could let him get out of position and create some headaches for his ‘d' partner. i think as he gets better at picking his spots, he could be a lethal offensive force for whichever team drafts him. i think he projects comfortably into a top-four role, but i just have a little more confidence in jiricek having a no. 1 defenseman ceiling compared to . the statistical comparables to draft year in the tipos extraliga are basically non-existent. he broke nearly every u21 record for defenders in the top slovak league and shone for his nation in most international events. is a right-shot kid with swagger and a mind for play creation. more of a problem-solver than a planner in transition, but has the tools to get away with it. he added creativity and shiftiness throughout the season. there's a top-pair upside here. šimon just put together the most productive draft year season from a defenceman in tipos extraliga history. in fact, marián hossa and marian gáborik are the only two other players in league history ever to best 26 points in 39 games as a first-time draft-eligible skater. some of that is survivorship bias in action. defencemen of quality don't usually play their draft year in the tipos extraliga; they fly for the czech extraliga or any other number of more challenging professional settings. the other part of the equation is that is just a really damn good hockey player. even a less difficult (all things be-ing relative) professional setting is still a professional setting, and he deserves a due of credit for the way he handled the assignment. it's not like hk nitra sheltered the 18-year-old slovak blueliner; his 20:15 a night in ice-time, according to our partners at instat, was third-highest on the team. how did pull it off? by constantly making the play at the time and rarely if ever deviating from his team's structure. you just won't find a more reliable, steady defenceman in this year's draft than . he isn't going to bring you out of your seat with any exhilarating displays of creativity or skill, but the trade-off is that he won't leave you shaking your head in disbelief at a poor decision or a costly turnover either. that posture isn't for a lack of skill or nhl-level tools. if anything, the opposite is true. we view as one of the draft's more toolsy defencemen, with above-average skating, handling, shooting, and passing skill. his one-timer is a veritable cannon. we also don't want you to get the idea that is strictly a stay-at-home defender either. while low percentage shots and an inability to create offensive advantages often marred our game reports for the 6-foot-1 blueliner, there was also a consistent appreciation for his offensive activations, be they on the rush or from the offensive blue line. he'll always take what's there. you would like to see that skill on the rush translate as a neutral zone defender, but that part of game is still a work in progress. a fairly accommodating gap and an inability to break down multivariable situations in space often conspired to leave the slovak defensive prospect help-less on the rush. his skating base and sense are such that should be able to iron out these parts of his game with time, but for now anyway, they represent something of an achilles heel in his game. overall, though, has one of the highest floors in this class. it's all too easy to imagine a scenario where he's playing top-four minutes in the nhl, featuring in both phases of special teams, and leveraging his tools and sense for consistently good-not-great points totals. any team would be happy to find such a player with a top-10 pick. risk management ability goes away, and on the breakout, where the forecheck can force him into imprecise passes. he has the patterns, but not the hockey sense to back it up. few players have been as dominant at the pro-level before their 18th birthday as . with a whopping 65 points in 112 games as a defenseman, has shown his game is mature enough to play against men. has all the makings of a modern-day first-pairing defenseman. an excellent skater, has a strong first pass and can keep and drive possession with his excellent instincts and puck mobility in the offensive zone. while strong offensively, he isn't a liability defensively either. he anticipates the play well defensively and has excellent gap control. rarely panics under pressure with the puck and makes excellent seam passes when being forechecked against. he also has excellent hands, making him a strong two-way threat whenever he is on the ice. some scouts have david jiricek above in this draft, but due to his proven production, i think has a slightly higher upside. he is likely a year away from nhl duty and projects as a top-pairing defender. is a mobile two-way and highly-intelligent slovak blueliner with all the makings of an elite top pairing defenseman. the standout in his game is his poise and confidence with the puck on his stick and how that is able to fuel his advanced playmaking game. he's a heads-up player at the offensive blue line, constantly surveying the offensive zone with his head on a swivel when the puck is on his stick to identify where teammates and potential offensive threats are. he's a smooth skater who is able to walk the line and use his legs to activate from the point when the puck is on his stick, allowing him to open up passing and shooting lanes with his mobility as well as making opposing checkers bite with his hands and shoulder fakes. his offensive vision is excellent, as he's capable of finding teammates with cross-ice passes to set up one-time opportunities and can feed teammates in the slot when handling the puck along the boards. he's a crisp and accurate passer who can deliver passes on the tape with purpose, as well as being capable of making soft finesse passes off both his forehand and backhand. he is also a more than capable puck-mover, as when he's working at his best his mobility, vision, and passing ability all combine to allow him to move pucks to teammates to start the breakout or move pucks himself. he's a capable defender who owns a good stick to breakup opposing rushes when defending in transition and he's generally well-positioned when defending in his own zone. in order to maximize his potential, will need to continue to work on his consistency in his reads to trim out some defensive turnovers out of his game, as well as show more growth in his strength and physicality.\", \" is a dynamic player. when he has the puck on his stick you instantly notice him because of his high-end speed, skill and offensive iq. he can make highly creative dekes and passes at full speed. the pace of his game is why i think he will be a top nhl player. he takes pucks up the ice and to the net often. lacks size, but he plays hard. he can drive play at even strength while also having the vision and shot to be a power-play threat running a unit from the walls. he projects as a first-line forward; as a he would be a low-end first-line in the nhl. is a beautiful, flowing skater capable of beating defenders off the mark, circling the zone to get defenders watching him with the puck, and manipulate them with his footwork and maneuverability in tight spaces. he's got an uncanny ability to side-step and hop around oncoming players at speed. he's got a great sixth sense for timing and spacing around the offensive zone which frees him to accept passes or jumps him onto rebounds. he regularly flashes skill to the inside, slicing to the middle and pulling pucks through or around defenders. he's also a swiss army knife player who combines nhl speed and skill with a working attitude to push the pace, make plays, win races, stay involved, and get onto the ice in all situations. i love his tempo and feel for the game out there. his touch with the puck and hands both get high grades, his skating (particularly his change of pace) and energy level are both differentiators, and those things make for a pretty compelling package. you won't find a scout who doesn't like him, either. the transition game into the offensive zone. the vision off the wall. he can play interior or exterior. he's incredibly crafty in control. he can stickhandle in a phone booth. he creates problems for defencemen attacking on angles and shifting at speed. he also has a scrappiness to his game that keeps him in the fight. is for sure one of the more well-rounded and talented players in the entire 2022 draft class. he certainly projects as a top-6 forward, who could play anywhere in the lineup and be able to contribute without question. based off his play to start the season, it wouldn't come as a shock to see name come off the draft board within the first 5 picks, possibly even inside the top 3. plenty of teams will fawn over his abilities and depending on the situation he's drafted into, that team may be able to sway his decision to forego the next season, and head straight to the nhl. over the last several months, i have constantly debated who was no. 1. i had at no. 1 at the mid-term and i waffled over the next few months when wright started picking up his play. that also coincided with dipping in production and playing a more complicated game than he needed to. but the reasons i had no. 1 then are the reasons i have him there now. this is not a great draft at the top, but he's this draft's most dynamic player with the greatest potential for explosive offense. with high-end speed and the ability to make high-level plays on the rush, he does things most players in this class cannot. while he played with a brilliant supporting class at the this year – as you'll see down this list at the number of u.s. u18s in the first-round range – was always heads above the rest in terms of the plays he could create and the way he dictated shifts throughout the season. i believe he can be a no. 1 at the next level if he continues on his current trend line. he competes on every inch of the ice and can play a strong north-south game despite his ability to stretch defenses with his east-west skill. as i've watched the playoffs this year, my thinking shifted even more. the best teams have fast, dynamic forwards that are constantly keeping defenders on their heels. they don't cede possession without trying all of their other options. processes the game as fast as anyone in this draft and his ability to spot plays in transition is a major separator from the field. he has vision, threads passes well and can get behind defenders to give himself better looks at the net. is headed to the university of next year, which has been a solid training ground the last few years for players on the nhl track. i think he's probably a one-and-done in player and would be ready to make an nhl impact by 2023-24. in the end it's not about when he arrives, but how he progresses. i think he has the highest ceiling of any of the top three nhl prospects and plays the style most consistent with the modern nhl's. speed is a premium and he brings it in spades, with the ability to finish plays as well as anyone else in this class. if everything goes for him, and that's always a big if with any player's i think could be a superstar in the league. a highly creative, speed-driven pivot who brings a lot of pop down the middle. really showed his ability to activate and make plays off of the rush this season. very exciting hands to go with the quick feet. should be able to play a comprehensive, all-situations role in a few years. you won't find a more singularly-gifted puckhandler in this year's draft than . he's a human highlight-reel, swashbuckling his way through defenders like a hot knife cuts through butter. it all starts with the first touch, and has the best one in this class. the way he seamlessly blends pass recep-tions at speed into his first move without breaking stride is almost unfair. whether it's catching a difficult pass on the backhand, forehand, or inside a crossover -- making it happen. it's like watching a wide receiver with an unlimited catch radius. the way keeps his top hand pushed out from his body as a handler for the full range of motion, changes speeds and lanes through the neutral zone, and deceives with shoulder feints and look-offs -- this is pro-level stuff. you can rest assured that this part of his game is going to scale up to the nhl in at least some capacity. more than just an and1 mixtape on skates, though. he's one of the rare triple-threat scorers in this draft. all of those moves serve a purpose, whether it's drawing in defenders to create space elsewhere, opening up passing lanes, or getting into better shooting positions. think of it as controlled chaos. there -- the vision and anticipation to see developing plays, the cunning and deception to make them more easily attain-able, and the touch as a distributor to connect. our only real concern with projection is the ab-sence of any high-end tools outside of his skill as a handler. even then, tendency to play beyond his considerable skill level often turns his greatest asset into a liability. there were just far too many turnovers and low percentage plays in his draft year for our liking. on the one hand, you want to see a gifted player like test the limits of their game every time he takes the ice; on the other, a little discretion would go a long way. where managed to allay our concerns on that front was with his growth this season as an off-the-puck scoring threat. it showed our staff that there was a way for him to stay involved in his team's offence even when he's not driving play personally. the proof of concept that he can produce in a more selfless fashion. supports the play well, consistently displays an understanding of the rotation habits of everyone on the ice, perfectly times his movements into space, and prepares his body and footwork to send one- and two-touch attempts on goal as the puck finds him. still, it wouldn't hurt to add another gear as a skater. he's a bit top-heavy, lacks explosive lateral mobility, and sometimes struggles to access his outside edges. he's about an nhl average skater as currently constructed, and it's definitely a part of his game that could stand to improve. overall, though, there's no disputing no. 1 centre upside, even if it's hardly a foregone conclusion that he gets there at the height of his career. just having that within his range of realistic outcomes counts for a lot. a small, speedy dominated the and solidified himself in my top five as the season progressed. consistently took over games using his excellent speed and instincts. more of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, can drive a line on his own. he can run a powerplay and isn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to make a play. he is also a relentless forechecker and possession driver. plays with high tempo and energy. not only is he a great skater, but he is also incredibly agile and uses this ability to elude defenders. he is also excellent defensively and is rarely a liability in his own zone. makes excellent transition plays and finds ways to utilize all his teammates on a regular basis. he has shown he can drive a line and there is a dynamic quality to his game. is a likely top-five pick and could go as high as number two. he is slated to attend the university of next season. is likely one year away from nhl duty. juraj slafkovsky drives offense from the wing. he's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. he can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size. using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. while he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. with strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. on-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. he also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. he has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. his unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the nhl level. he is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. if he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt slafkovsky will be a force at the nhl for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. if he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly.\", \" is a big, right-shot defenseman who makes an impact at both ends of the rink. he has great individual skill to make opponents miss. you combine that with very good vision and a hard point shot, and inside the offensive zone he can make a lot happen and be dangerous on a power play. his skating won't dazzle, but for his size he gets around well enough. what his skating looks like post-knee surgery is something to monitor. he shows some shiftiness to pull away from checks, but lacks ideal speed and burst for the nhl level. despite that, he defends well due to his reach and a high level of physical play, often punishing opposing forwards with his body. he projects as a top-pair defenseman. after suffering a knee injury at the world juniors, returned in time to play with the czechia men's national team ahead of and into men's worlds in their april and may international schedule, an important series of games which helped him reaffirm to nhl clubs that the layoff wouldn't impact him. before the injury, he was a big part of a top team in the tipsport extraliga, contributing at both ends and driving possession and scoring results for the second consecutive season while playing more than 18 minutes a game. he has some extremely desirable attributes, marked by one of — if not the — hardest point shots in the draft (it's a bomb, and he does a really good job keeping it on target and a few feet off the ice), a strong, athletic 6-foot-3 frame, and a more commanding on-ice presence than nemec's. he's a strong and sturdy defender who plays a staunch man-to-man style, moves his feet well for his size, and thrives in transition with his ability to both close out on gaps with his length through neutral ice and lead a ton of rushes as a puck transporter. offensively, he's also a capable handler and distributor whose point shot is complemented by an aggressive approach. his game isn't as tactile as nemec's, but he's more than just an athletically gifted, hard-shooting, attacking (offensively and defensively) defender. there are also some subtleties to his game (passes that are almost never off-target, a sneaky-silky first touch, etc.). but his modus operandi is that he's a confident, active, engaged three-zone player who has all of the tools you look for in a top defender. as he continues to smooth out and polish his game, it's hard to imagine he doesn't become, at the very least, a top-four guy. and if he hits the notes along his path, his ceiling will be very high. he's hard not to get excited about, even if i prefer nemec's style. top pairing defenseman at the nhl level if he works on his positioning in the defensive zone and can continue work on acceleration when hunting for defensive recoveries. a highly mobile, 6-foot-3 defenseman with a bomb of a shot and solid puck-moving capabilities, has incredible upside relative to the class. he missed the second half of the season due to a knee injury, needing more than three months to rehab. returned in time to play for the czech national team at the men's world championship, showing that he's healthy and prepared to make an impact. when he played, he played well – showcasing that tremendous mobility and the physical stature that made him look no different than the professionals he was playing with and against. has played professionally over each of the last two seasons, more than holding his own as a youngster in a tough czech league. this year, he had 11 points with plzen. it is very possible he'd be back with plzen next season, unless the team that drafts him wants to bring him to north america to get started in the ahl. he still has a lot of ahead of him. that said, the skill set he has shown, the well-roundedness of his game and his size profile are all reasons i have him just a hair above nemec in this particular class. i think there's a little more ceiling for to reach. a knee injury fractured jiříček's season, but it was still a formidable one. the czechia defender plays a cerebral game with a bevy of physical tools. the skating was never a strong suit and since the injury, it's looked a little shakier. that will be item no. 1 to clean up. but if he can get that part of his game back on track, there's a legitimate top-four upside. jiříček finishes the year as the highest-ranked de-fenceman for elite prospects after a year-long dogfight with šimon nemec for the distinction. this endorsement, of course, marks something of a depar-ture from the industry consensus, but it's a position we've arrived at confidently. the more eyes our group set on jiříček, the more we came to admire the way he plied his trade. there were even some in our ranks who were so bold as to float the possibility of jiříček at no. 1 overall. the book on jiříček is a tome at this stage. he's already played two full years of professional hockey in the czech extraliga with hc plzeň, and he has a wealth of international experience that would be the envy of most 10-year nhl vet-erans. we're talking about close to 10 separate appearances in his country's colours the last two seasons, including a pair of trips to the world juniors and a tour on the czech blue line at this year's world hockey championship. and for the most part, jiříček handled each assignment admirably. his creativity at the offensive blue line, coupled with a constant drive to push the boundaries of his skill set, made him this draft's most compelling offensive defenceman. not content to unleash his cannon of a slap shot from the furthest recesses of the offensive zone, jiříček sought to create advantages in the attacking third with every touch. he would use the threat of his shot to open up passing lanes or skate into space to draw in defenders before sending the puck elsewhere. with natural agility and elusiveness as a skater, some skill as a handler, and an understanding of how to leverage his 6-foot-3 frame to protect the puck, there isn't any reason we can't expect this to continue to at least some degree in the nhl. now, there is some room for improvement there. jiříček doesn't settle for low percentage shots at the point, but that doesn't mean that the czech blueliner hasn't stepped into a few attempts that go off of a defender's shinpads and escape his team's possession from time to time. his handling me-chanics have proven inconsistent this season, too. the big question here, though, is whether an nhl coach will give jiříček the freedom to play his sometimes freewheel-ing style. it's going to play a critical role in determining his developmental arc. time will tell. there needn't be any concern over whether jiříček's going to be able to hang in a high leverage role at the nhl level, though. there's a durable defensive foundation in place that will carry him to a top-four role at a bare minimum, even if his play with the puck doesn't come along for the ride. the 18-year-old czech blueliner plays a tight gap through the neutral zone, deploys sound footwork defending the blue line, and contains exceptionally well in body-on-body defensive scenarios. few players in this draft can match jiříček as a play-stopper. you need to be able to move the puck in the contemporary nhl, and jiříček is up to that task, too. you'd like to see a little more scanning pre-touch on defensive zone retrievals, and maybe a little more patience with the puck sometimes, but we still view his transition game as an nhl-level part of his profile. in jiříček you're looking at a 6-foot-3, right-shot defenceman who can do just about everything at a low-end top-pairing level through the height of his career, and that's a hell of a return on one's investment at the top of the draft. similar to nemec, plays a mature game for his age. while nemec is a better skater, plays a more complete physical game. is a hard-hitter and loves to engage physically. his defensive game is his calling card, and he uses his frame well to break up plays. he also has a tremendously hard shot, perhaps the hardest slap shot of any defenseman in this draft. is an asset in all three zones, whether with or without the puck, making him a coveted player in the draft. he also excelled playing against men in the czech republic's top league. he doesn't bend under pressure and makes excellent puck decisions. a serious knee injury derailed much of his season, but he has appeared to make a full recovery. has some raw tools, plays with high pace, and is physically mature. his overall game needs to be more consistent, but that will come with time and maturity. he is likely two years away from full-time nhl duty and projects as a top-four defenseman at the nhl level. is an exceptional two-way defenseman who really helps drive the transition play with his mobility and his puck skills. he possesses a ton of patience and poise with the puck on his stick, using his head to scan the play, oftentimes looking like a veteran well above his age. he rarely rushes a decision with the puck, scanning all possible options before delivering a pass. his passing is one of his best attributes, making strong outlet dishes from the defensive zone to push the play up ice. there is not a pass on the ice that he doesn't feel he can't make, which makes it even more impressive that he rarely forces a low percentage pass that'll result in a turnover. his size and high-end skating make him a force at the defensive end of the ice. his ability to defend the rush is top-notch, using his body and stick to maintain solid gap control and easily steer oncoming attackers away from the lane and completely negating their offensive momentum. like any young player, there is some mental errors in his game that will start to disappear as he gets older and gains more playing experience and maturity. there are some mistimed pinches at times, leaving him having to race back to catch the play after getting burnt. on occasion, he tries to add some creativity in his game, from a little stutter-step at the blue line to a squeeze down the boards. this tends to end up in a turnover, so he should try to keep his game a little simpler. he projects as a top-pairing defenseman who will be heavily relied on to play in all situations in the nhl. has the physical gifts and the skillset to make a massive impact from the back end. it would not be a surprise if he is the first defenseman taken in the nhl draft.\"]\n",

            " played a lot of hockey this season between multiple levels of junior, pro and international hockey, and impressed almost every single time. he almost always seems to have an impact on a game. he's super talented but also an elite competitor. can make the flashy plays to deke defenders, but he rarely does that off a standstill or along the walls. he has hard skill. is typically full speed ahead to the net; and if he needs to go around or through you, he will. he's also a very good playmaker and finisher who can take advantage of space if defenders make off him by making a pass or sniping from a distance. quite often he made passes this season that were elite, but he didn't rack up that many assists. the one thing that bugs me about him is his skating. his stride is a little awkward and inefficient, he's hunched over, kicks his heels out, but he generates decent speed and hustles so hard that any technical flaw isn't that exposed. he has two years on his contract with and told the athletic he intends to see that contract out. u18 coach vladimir filatov on : “he's the heart of a team. he always wants to set an example on and off the ice. he's maybe not the most elite skill player or an elite sniper, but he's a leader, he runs the game. his game is always about controlling the puck, pushing the play forward and putting everything on the net.” has age on his side (june 24, 2001) but his play has continued to leave me wanting more. the skill set is there. he gets to his top speed quickly and his top speed is a lot to handle in transition (more north-south than east-west), he's physical, has excellent hands and he can really — and i mean really — shoot it (though his drawback is a little too long for my liking). it all goes back to knowing how to use the skill that i touched on above. is an instinctual player who makes plays for himself but struggles to involve his teammates and the end result is a contrast between what your eyes tell you (they notice him a lot) and how effective he actually is. he has time to figure the rest of it out but it's extremely hard to be a dominant nhl player on skill and skill alone. teams don't want to use a top-10 pick on a player who may become a checking third-liner who can play with pace and irritate teams but doesn't actually produce all that much. there's room for him to be a lot more than that but he needs to put all of the pieces together and i'm more certain today than i was in my midseason ranking that his top-five buzz is unwarranted. he has become a hot draft topic because of his relatively quiet finish to the season and the fact that he remains under contract for the next two years. the fact that his rights are owned by st. petersburg causes some nervousness, as the club tends to hold on to guys. it's important to note, however, that is represented by newport sports in north america, and it's hard to imagine it'd take on a client who didn't plan to come over at some point. remains an exceptional talent, with high-end skill and power in his game. he has a mean streak, gets on pucks quickly and can finish. wasn't dominating in the same way at the end of the season, and his club play was underwhelming, but i've maintained all year that he was never put in a great position to succeed this season because he played at three different levels in but when is at his best, few in this class are better. he does a little bit of everything and does almost all of it very well. there might not be a single player in this draft whose tape i've enjoyed as much as vasili . he's a throwback power forward, capable of bulldozing his way through a defensive pair with ease and taking the puck to the net for a goal or a grade-a scoring chance on any shift. has silky smooth mitts to match that power and is a strong skater with a determined work ethic who seems only capable of playing at full-speed. the fact that works even harder without the puck is going to endear him to his coaches — seems basic enough, but it's not always a given with players in this age group. this play is a perfect example of the type of three-zone player is. that is throwing that two-for-one hit to dispossess the opposition of the puck in a vhl game, against men, just highlights what an absolute unit he is. i've gone on record, several times, expressing the joy that i get from watching vasili play hockey. even if rank took a hit from the pre-u18 spot at no. 3 overall, i still feel that way about the way he plays the game. he's a bull in a china shop. a throwback power forward who can take over a hockey game on a moment's notice; the type of player that general managers covet in the playoffs. even though didn't show as well as many had hoped in the u18 tournament, i'm not quite ready to cast him from the top ten entirely. we're talking about a seven-game sample, after all. i'm similarly unphased by his supposed lack of production in the mhl, a league that isn't exactly renowned for its scoring — people made the same arguments about florida panthers first-round pick grigori denisenko last year. besides, put up decent numbers in the men's league, the vhl, which is one tier removed from the unfortunately for , turcotte and byram happened to show as the better prospects over the full-year sample. they also have the premium position angle going for them. can be a bit of a polarizing prospect. he is one of the most exciting players to watch in the draft. he is a tenacious forechecker who isn't afraid to crash the net. he also possesses excellent offensive skills. biggest knock was his inability to put up points in the leagues he was playing in. however, he also played for a number of different teams and lacked consistent linemates. overall, podzolkin has all the tools to be a successful top 6 winger power forward in the nhl. he will likely spend the next two seasons playing in as he is still under contract. his incredible speed is just the beginning of his skill and not only can he skate hard and fast straight, his side-to-side motion helps him create some jaw-dropping plays. his puck control is high end and he has incredible vision with the puck. not just able to dangle and toe drag, he knows how to make great passes tape-to-tape. his play helps create scoring chances for his teammates, too. a force to be reckoned with each time he is on the ice, his explosive skating and speed help him carry the puck with ease. always knows where to be on the ice and his ability to keep the play alive helps his team's possession numbers. he's dangerous on the power play and a consistent scoring threat. he's also known for his two-way game and is consistently engaged in the defensive zone. willing to sacrifice his body to block shots and never backs down from a puck battle. his style is in a category of its own and his unpredictable play makes it hard for defenses to read him. his hockey iq is outstanding and he plays with an energy and creativity that is rare for players his age. always assessing his options on the ice, he is smart, patient and not mistake prone. his love for the game shows in his play and he is fun to watch. his size is the only knock on this player.\n",

            " ' season was cut short due to the ajhl's pause. he was up and down during that season, but his u18 worlds was promising and his underage profile is encouraging. is a complete defenseman as a 6-foot-2, right-shot blueliner who is mobile, hard to play against and has offensive ability. at the ajhl level, he showed great one-on-one skill and the ability to move the puck. he kills a lot of rushes with his skating and physicality and picks off a lot of passes. at the higher levels of play i've watched him over the years i've questioned if the offense will translate at a top level, particularly the playmaking. but i see enough good things in his puck moving to think he can be a good nhl player. in a sentence, projects as a quality top-four nhl defenseman who could possibly be on a second power-play unit with the potential to play higher in a lineup. there's a lot to like about ' package. he's right-handed. he's big, and sturdy, and athletic and he uses his heaviness to play a rugged style against the rush and in his own zone along the wall (though he can also settle into lackadaisical defensive posture a little too often and get caught puck-watching). he's also capable offensively, with an attacking style which is complemented by a hard point shot (off of his snap shot and his low slap shot) and quick offensive-zone instincts through holes as they open. i do have some reservations about his game, though, including a propensity for mistakes and turnovers and some trouble with his gaps getting caught flatfooted. a strong performance at u18 worlds did help to massage some of those worries because he did a really good job playing within himself while remaining aggressive, but a bet on is a bet on his raw pro tools. if he can put it all together, he'll be a very good pro defenceman. this towering right-handed shot is a staunch defender who also pitches in offensively. using his size to advantage, is especially tough on opposing forwards along the boards. perennially eager to join the rush, he skates well and carries the puck out of his own zone with confidence. his shot is widely admired. in the 14 games divvied up between the bandits and under-18 squad, contributed five goals and 14 assists. destined for the university of in the short term, this 18-year-old is one to watch as a potential nhl power-play quarterback of the future. it's a given: will be drafted much higher than his position on the elite prospects ﬁnal ranking for the 2021 nhl entry draft. unfortunately, we haven't seen enough from the brooks bandits defender to match with his top-20 billing in this draft. we thought maybe those would show at the u18s -- that maybe he would come in, raise the level of his game, and ﬁnally live up to his reputation -- but it didn't happen. it was just more of the same from ; he continued to raise more questions than he answered. we see the skill in ' game. his tools are imperfect -- he skates hunched over with his rear-end raised and his weight on his toes, and he handles with his top-hand stuck to his hip, limiting his range of motion -- but, even considering the mechanical ﬂaws, his skating and handling could become above nhl average in a few years. and we can't forget his in-stride wrist-shot from the point -- one of the better weapons in the draft, when he gets it through. and therein lies the problem with game. the tools are there, but their expression leaves a lot to be desired. take his release for example. too many times, ﬁres it at shin pads. he fails to properly read his gap with defenders, their positioning, and doesn't move when he receives the puck. he catches and ﬁres from the same point on the ice, making it easy for defenders to ﬁnd the shooting lane and block it. “even in the ajhl, he isn't all that effective at the offensive blue-line,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a november game report. “he shoots at shin pads, doesn't create any separation with the puck because he lacks explosiveness (poor skating stance) and his moves feel pre-planned, as if he is executing drills in a practice” “he is not reading the defence in front of him and breaking it, but simply trying stuff until something evident opens up (like a perfect seam through the slot). (...). his projection is based on tools, mostly his handling skills. his skating is better than he wants to show. ” the defenceman rarely thinks ahead on the ice. this ﬂaw was especially evident in transition at the u18s. due to a lack of scanning before and after getting the puck, his decisions were either slow or rushed. he went glass-and-out when the pressure mounted. these tendencies led him to ﬁnish with one of the lowest controlled zone exits percentage in the entire tournament. his puck-carrying is another element of his game that lacks projectability. can move around defenders by freezing them with handling moves, but his hands will only carry him so far at the next levels. to beat set pro defences, he will need to involve teammates in his rushes a lot more, which means carrying the puck in his hip-pocket, in a pass-ready position, instead of handling it in front, which exposes it to poke-check and forces him into constant dangles to keep it on his stick. at the u18 tournament, shined more defensively than offensively, which suggests that, when the competition tightens up, this is the type of game he will play at higher levels. his shutdown abilities still need reﬁnement -- better threat identiﬁcation, tighter gaps through the neutral zone, more controlled and deceptive poke-checking motions -- but his aggressiveness and physicality are very projectable to the nhl. can pinch, engage opponents, box them out, control them on the boards, and shove them away from the puck. he ﬁnished with one of the better in-zone defence scores in the tournament's tracking data, which was surprising after seeing some of his lapses in the ajhl. the competition will do a lot of good to . a more structured game should alleviate some of the issues with his reads and help him develop better on-ice planning. teammates will be in more predictable positions and that predictability will help his passing game. the extra time in the gym will also help him hone his tools and those give him a lot of different pathways to develop his offensive skills still, because of the number of improvements needed for to turn into top-four calibre defencemen, we felt more comfortable having him further down our board. is an offensive-minded defenseman, though with a much lower ceiling. has a plethora of raw tools and talent. he is still growing into his frame, and yet he already uses it well. ability to create offense, currently, is more of a result of his raw skill than positioning. part of this is a result of the league he plays in (lower skill level than others on this list), and his ability to use his overall skill set to his advantage. however, there are questions about how his overall game will translate to a higher league. biggest weakest is his defensive play and awareness. next year may be a bit of a difficult year for him in an transition to as he will be asked to play with more structure and will be relied on less to drive play. when playing against his peers at the under-18's, excelled, averaging over a point-per-game and showing his game may at least translate quickly on the offensive side of things. projects as a top-four offensive-minded defender at the nhl level. he will likely need three to four years of before he is nhl ready. is a dynamic, deceptive skater who has the ability and creativity to manufacture all sorts of advantageous scenarios with speed and angle changes via pivots or living on his edges. he can make so many subtle adjustments in motion to catch and contain or deliver pucks via the pass to teammates. he can make elite level plays while shifting his weight and when he's carrying the puck, even though he's not a small guy or the fastest player on the ice, he feeds false information consistently with his head, hands and feet which creates hesitation that allows for a new opening to be created. habitually he's a player who will be a consistent threat to activate or lead the rush and often funnels down middle lanes to get below the tops of the circles where he can either set up a deke or get a quick, hard shot off. in zone offensive scenarios he's consistently rotating and never sticking in one place for long and gains the middle of the ice as soon as possible where he can feed teammates off of his forehand or backhand or shift to play between checks and present himself as a shot option in threatening areas. his skating mechanics are quite translatable to the next level with strong use of his outer edge and positive shin angle which allows superior versatility in terms of his mobility and power generation. he's got great offensive impulses. his skating is a big strength to keeping him matched with opponents and even though he has to work on check attachment, approach to angling, body position and stick detail doused opportunity and allowed him to retain inside position. the biggest issue with is that there is a distinct lack of consistency when it comes to that effort level, especially on the defensive end. he can come off as lazy or reckless with pucks on his stick and limit himself to few options when he's calling his own number to attack, showing an advantage in creative thought processes but limited in his capacity to solve problems. he plays a very aggressive, risky game with his puck rushes, pinches and gap control, so turnovers and offensive breaks against are common. has a ton of raw upside and could easily become one of the very best players from this draft class if his goes according to plan.\n",

            " was fantastic in the for the past two seasons, as one of the most dominant jr. a players of the modern era. he's one of the most entertaining and dynamic players in the draft. his skating, hands and vision all get plus grades. he can push the pace with his speed. he's got quick-twitch feet at full speed, which allows him to jet by defenders, and great edge work to create space in tight areas. he's often asked to carry the puck up the ice, and he does so very well. makes plays at full speed, often blowing by defenders, while also being able to pull up and make a play at pace. i've seen him make some very creative passes where he hits a tight lane with little time or hitting a man on the tape while he's going 100 miles an hour. he's also very skilled, and often makes tough plays to lose a defender and create space. isn't just a skill guy, he competes well too, which combined with his great speed allows him to always be around the puck. i don't know if he'll be a true defensive in the nhl due to his size and i wouldn't call him overly physical, but i like that he battles. the one knock on is, at the levels with higher pace than the such as the world jr. a or hlinka u18 camp where he was cut, he wasn't dominant; but he was great at the iihf u18 tournament. victoria grizzlies gm/coach craig didmon on : “he has great endurance, he doesn't tire and wears his opponents down. he can attack in a variety of ways. he has great speed, a great shot on the fly and sees the ice very well. he can play 200 feet.” the thing about a lot of players who can burn defenders wide with explosive speed is that that speed can often work against them. they begin to rely on it and their instinct is to just turn on the jets whenever the puck hits their stick. for many players, that speed forces them wide into areas of the ice where offence is hard to come by. it was my biggest criticism of devils draftee michael mcleod. a skill only takes you as far as your know-how. you need to be able to use it. has that speed but his brilliance is that he seldom wastes it. he knows when to pull up and find the trailer. he knows when to cut under the defender and drive the net. and he knows when to slow things down. but when the opportunity is there to burn wide or use his release at top speed (which he does effortlessly), will take it. he's electric and fearless. has high-end skills with skating that is probably just shy of elite. he can dance on the ice at times, using quick hand skills to beat defenders one-on-one while always knowing his next play. he gets shots off quickly and finds teammates well under pressure. having averaged 1.92 points per game, he had the seventh-best season ever by a u18 player in the offense-happy requires patience because he needs to get stronger and needs to be harder to play against in more physical, tightly checked games, but that skill is tantalizing. there was some concern among the scouting community about slow start (all things being relative) to the season with victoria, but he's since hit his groove and finished the season on an absolute tear with the victoria grizzlies in the with a strong showing at the u18 ( had a hat-trick against belarus in a pre-tournament friendly match last weekend), could easily find a home in the top ten of most scouts' boards. , committed to for next season, is the complete offensive package. his skating is elite, as can swerve through or around entire defensive units with relative ease. the coordination between his hands and feet to add an element of creativity that not many centres possess — a defenceman can tie up stick, but that hardly means he's out of the play. can work a mean mohawk with his skates to freeze defenceman and open up lanes, too. this play is a perfect example of those deft, subtle touches that make him such a productive offensive player. with a little and seasoning at — a great — can develop into a high-end second-line centre at the nhl level. if one can find that player around tenth overall, that's an excellent snag. sure, victoria grizzlies centre started the season slowly, but he more than made up for it by the end, producing at almost a two points per game pace in spite of it. just imagine if had started the season anywhere near as strongly as he'd finished it. i've found that is one of the better skaters in this year's draft, owing to an explosive first two steps, high-end acceleration and a top-gear that's elite. footwork, agility and heel-to-heel skating are high, high-end. he can skate circles around the opposition if he wants to. literally. i'm not sure that i envision no. 1 centre upside for at the nhl level, but i feel good about his ability to develop into a defensively responsible two-way centre in time. he's going to a great with next season, where i suspect he'll play a full two years. from there — watch out! is a well-rounded offensive player and one of the most underrated players in the draft. part of this is due to the league plays in. the is a tier ii junior league in well below the level on the west coast. yet, many nhl players and strong prospects have come from this league, and it's a direct feeder to the put up 102 points and scored at almost a 2 points per game pace. he also produced at every major international event for his age group this past season. projects as a high-end number 2 at the nhl level. he is likely 2-3 years away from regular nhl duty. an agile skater, accelerates quickly to gain separating speed and is able to dash past defenders. strong skater at his level, but he will need to improve explosiveness and raw power. offensively driven player, he handles the puck with finesse and excels when leading a rush. manages game well in the offensive zone under pressure. shows great hockey sense, but needs to work on his consistency to play motivated. a pass first player with above average vision, he has the tools to take advantage of the other team's mistakes. sometimes can pass too often when the better play is to shoot. not really strong on the dot. weaker presence physically as well when challenged and seldom steps up to hard areas of the ice. defensively, he lacks intensity and drive and doesn't appear engaged in the play in his own end. keeps stick in puck lanes and will step in front of shots, but avoids getting into battles. away from the puck in the defensive zone, he looks to break the zone, stretch the ice and transition quickly. there is still more work needed to play tighter in his own zone and use his feet to get him in position to use his body to take the man off the puck. overall great hockey iq, but he needs to bring the intensity up a notch more consistently to succeed at the next level.\n",

            " is hard to miss when he's on the ice. he's a little fireball who is full of skill. he is a very imaginative puckhandler, with some of the best hands in the draft who can beat most defenders with his dekes. if he can't get through someone with his skill, he shows no fear to lower his shoulder and barrel towards the net. he's also quite physical off the puck and competes at a high level. for a 5-foot-11 player, he lacks the skating ability you'd like to see to separate from checks. the talent and production is great, but he was suspended several times this season, including for spitting on a player. in a sentence, projects as a middle-six nhl winger who will need to control his aggression. a lot to handle. he's difficult to knock off balance. when he leans into his shot (which he does often), it whips off of his stick. when he's ramped up and engaged, he's a pesky, physical, powerful winger who can barrel at, or through, opponents to the middle-third of the ice. he can really impose himself on the game. but i've also seen him play games where he has a negative impact on play. i've been warned by two sources about his attitude — he was suspended this year for spitting on an opponent — and he's got a short temper that puts him in the penalty box too much for my liking. he's going to need to learn to play within himself and stay on the side of a fine line. and while he possesses a lot of the tools teams look for in “hard to play against” middle-six scorers with skill, buyer beware. he's going to be picked higher than this but i can't seem to wrap my head around some of his actions. but, let's move away from the statistics and hone in on his playing style. what i love about is his transitional play. in the neutral zone, is constantly finding open lanes and gaps that he can exploit. he will find open lanes to provide his teammates with a low trafficked avenue to pass the puck through. given how dangerous is at driving to the net and pilling up high danger scoring chances, his transitional play allows him to start his magic from the blueline. from a defensive and forechecking perspective, game has evolved quite a bit from his midget and bantam days. when it comes to his hands, is an efficient stickhandler, especially when he is driving to the net. in the offensive zone, thrives in the low slot/doorstep. most of his primary assists and goals come down low. the only other attribute that needs further is his puck control. while has some attributes that needs to be ironed out, i want to talk about how lethal his wrist shot is. he has solid range with his wrist shot and will use it quite a bit in the mid to high slot. four suspensions in a condensed season is four too many. tempestuous, nonsensical behaviour aside though, the talent is there. strong on the puck, is an aggressive handful with a great shot. the versatile forward is also an excellent passer and agitating presence with a gift for getting under an opponent's skin. if can figure out how to keep himself in check, some nhl team will benefit from getting one of the better power forwards available in this draft. may not have top-six skill, but the path to a full-time role on an nhl checking line seems pretty straight forward. he's violent, mean, and sometimes struggles to walk the line as an agitator, but there's also some nice skill in his game. has a mean streak that's already nhl calibre, and he has some skill to go alongside it. that's going to make him a hot commodity at the 2021 nhl entry draft. the question for most scouts is whether is skilled enough to play the part of a power forward or if he'll take on more of a grinder's role at the professional level. the nhl has a lot of time for either player type, but they can't help themselves with the former. so much of game is deﬁned by his physicality. he's an enthusiastic hitter, one who's put more than his fair share of poor opponents into the boards or onto their asses. he'll get under his opponent's skin after the whistles. he'll ﬁght. he'll mix it up. to borrow a line from one of my scout friends, he's the type of player who makes your lizard brain happy. sometimes, though, he steps over the line. the physicality that makes him such an unwieldy force becomes a hindrance that puts his team in bad spots. you can see that just by gleaning his 47 penalty minutes, good for the ﬁfth-most in the ‘q last season and third-most on a per-game basis. the website has him down for four (4!) suspensions in last year's shortened season, including one served for spitting on an opponent. the obvious challenge for is to walk the line a little bit better without taking too much off of his fastball. that's easier said than done, and some players never ﬁgure it out, but that's the task ahead. the thing is, doesn't need to maim his opponents to be effective. he's got plenty to offer with the rest of his game to generate value. he plays at pace, takes the inside lane, and drives the net with the puck. if his skating stride was a little bit cleaner, we might even be able to conﬁdently project his rush offence to the next level. “his skating is absolutely a problem, from his lack of depth to wide stride recovery,” elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell wrote in an october game report. “sometimes, he's not bending his knees at all. a failure to extend his strides (almost zero toe-snap) results in a huge waste of energy.” we've no suh doubts about playmaking. he's a decent puck-handler, with a decent shot that he can get off in stride, but his playmaking is on an entirely different level. he knows his options, shows the patience to let lanes open, changes angles to create other passing lanes, and shows some real creativity as a distributor in pressure situations. his problem-solving ability through secondary and tertiary defensive variables lets him make plays where others would struggle to retain possession. granted, lack of planning often puts him in positions where he has to problem-solve his way through trouble. his inability to separate from opponents and a lack of outside edge use to manoeuvre away from crunchy spots turn what should be a luxury skill into a necessity on almost a shift-to-shift basis. the same is true of his inability to alternate through different rush patterns and the absence of an east-west game in space. he's just plain predictable with the puck sometimes. there's also the unfortunate fact that , perhaps ﬁttingly, picked up a lot of his points by bullying the cape breton eagles (one of the ‘q's weaker teams), and struggled to score against the charlottetown islanders (one of the ‘q's stronger teams). you take with the good with the bad and even the uncertainty of it all with . that's just the nature of his game. it might be enough to send him to the nhl in a middle-six scoring role with some upside in both phases of special teams. wasn't released for the under-18's, which was probably a detriment for what has been a somewhat up and down season for the however, he still managed to put up well over a point-per-game in the will be a hot commodity heading into the 2021 draft due to his combination of grit, tenacity, and skill. there's a mean streak to his game, which has also gotten him in trouble a few times this season. however, when he is playing under control, is an absolute handful in the offensive zone. though not overly large, is incredibly strong. he protects the puck well and excels down-low in the cycle game. he crashes the net with regularity and loves to mix it up with opposing defenders. as the nhl continues to transition to more of a skill-based game, players like are highly sought after because of what they can bring to the table overall. that being said, l'heuruex will need to learn how to better control the tenacious part of his game. his skating could also use some work and he could be more consistent offensively. whoever drafts is getting a bit of a project, but he has top-six forward potential. he is a few years away from nhl duty. is a hard-hitting power forward who uses his incredible strength and tremendous puck protection to work the puck through dirty areas. his impressive physical presence allows him to dominate corners, winning a good portion of his puck battles and making opponents pay with heavy checks. his great balance and core-strength makes him extremely tough to knock off the puck, which is, in part, why he's able to control the disc in traffic so effortlessly. the prospect owns some outstanding goalscoring abilities as well. his wrist shot release is quick and his great power forces swift adjustment from goaltenders. he also displayed great finishing instincts to get into dangerous areas and find the puck with excellent stick-work. his playmaking can be inconsistent, as he shows great vision at times, but does not always have great accuracy, especially on his backhand. he's sound and smart in possession of the puck and will often have his head up to read plays. has a wonderful skating form, as he perfectly leans over to generate more power, extends his leg fully, and makes big push on each stride. the same can be said about his crossovers, where he makes tremendous pushes with his inside leg, allowing him to gain more speed. however, he lacks explosion and consistency in his skating. his first few steps can be particularly slow, which creates difficulties in separating himself from opponents in foot races and prevent him from arriving first on loose pucks. he rarely uses his full-skating abilities too and only does so when he's got an open lane to the offensive zone with the puck. seems disinterested to put effort on the backcheck or in his own zone at times, frequently gliding back without much intentions other than watch the play develop. finally, physical presence and grit, while a strength in some cases, has raised concerns this season. he was suspended four times this season, bringing his discipline up as cause for concern. there are times where he makes reckless and dangerous decisions on the ice. if he can reign this in moving forward and utilize the sandpaper-style of gameplay into a positive, he could develop into a star player at the next level.\n",

            " was good in switzerland's second-tier pro league, with the season canceled, and great at the u18 worlds for has always shown he can score — and in numbers. he can attack defenses in numerous ways in the offensive zone with his nhl-caliber skill, vision and shot. he is a creative player who tries to make things happen. he has the shot to score from range versus pros and is very good at creating around the net. he works hard enough to win a lot of puck battles. the main flaw in skill set is his skating, as he will be ok in the nhl in that regard but will struggle to create separation. in a sentence, projects as a strong top-six forward in the nhl, a second-line or a low-end first-line wing. there are players in every draft class who really grab the limelight as the year progresses. in 2020, it was jake sanderson, jack quinn and seth jarvis. in 2019, it was moritz seider. and while was a top prospect in his own growing up and into his rookie season in the last year, he did a lot in a short amount of time to become that player in this draft. it really crescendoed in a big performance at u18 worlds, but i would argue that best hockey of this season came in the final games of the regular season and into the swiss league playoffs with olten. after a slow start, he became a force in switzerland's second-tier pro league, overwhelming players sometimes twice his age with his size and his heaviness. it can be hard to spot “competitiveness” in players and i think we can think we see it and then place too much emphasis on it when we do, but is a competitive, heavyset player with an nhl shot and a middle-lane approach. he's going to need to work to stay in top shape throughout his career and there are still times when i think he can tunnel-vision, but he's got a real case to be taken in the draft's first half-dozen picks and i doubt he's still available at this ranking. when you are watching , the zone that you most notice him in is the offensive zone. constantly is looking for the opposition to pull closer towards the perimeter. he looks for opportunities where his teammates are controlling the puck in low danger. wants the puck in low danger and the opposition playing tight at the perimeter. he wants that because the opposition is not paying close attention to the slot. so, he picks the moment when the opposition is coming closer to the point as the moment where he skates up to the high slot and gives his team an open man close to the net. n the defensive zone, is strong on the back-check. when deployed on the wing, he shows off his physical grittiness and can be a hand full for wingers and defenders running the cycle along the boards. but, when he is utilized at he plays more of an insurance support role and won't appear to be as gritty. we've touched on stride extension a few times throughout the report, so i'm going to keep that section relatively short. even though there are some power skating issues, he has worked on his skate extension since last season with peterborough and i have seen him use a couple of lengthy first steps in the offensive zone when going to chase after a loose puck. before a star turn at the iihf under-18 championship this year, attracted positive attention by scoring nine goals and two assists in 13 games against professionals in switzerland. armed with a vicious and deceptive wrist shot, he's exceptionally dangerous in the low slot or, preferably, in and around the crease, banging in a rebound. eager to exploit his size -- this young man is solid -- plays heavy and doesn't back down from the nastier work in the corners or, again, in front of an opposing goaltender. while only a so-so skater, the swiss-born canadian is an adept passer and a tough and skilled customer, with and without the puck. thinks the game at such an absurdly high level, it's almost enough to make us forego any concerns about a wildly inefficient, poor skating stride. he's a playmaking centre with a great knack for small-area passes. may not be the best two-way centre in the draft, but he really isn't that far the more eyes our group set on , the more conﬁdent we became in our evaluation. eventually, that resulted in ascending to ﬁfth overall in our post-u18 world hockey championships ranking. that's where he'll ﬁnish the season, too. there just aren't many more reliable players in this draft than . he makes the play at the time and in the place every single shift. you know what you're getting from him every time he steps onto the ice. hardly sacriﬁces any skill for that consistency either. he's never going to manipulate opponents in space like matthew beniers, william eklund, or even fabian lysell, but his small area game is up there with the best in this class. here's what makes so special, though. it's not that he dominates in the small area game with dazzling 10-bell manoeuvres, swashbuckling his way through defenders. it's that he courts contact, using it as a means to create space. his ability to weaponize physicality and manipulate defenders is so advanced for a player this age. “some wall-play details in this game from (again),” one of our lead scouts, , remarked in a game report from the u18s. “he moves one way, drags the defender that way, makes them turn their feet, and then passes to supporting teammates in the opposite direction.” “he seems to have an instinct for it in small areas. he also gets off the wall to attack inside and plays the goal-line role well on the power play; he spins from his position to attack the net and has a knack for ﬁnding holes in the goalie as he does it.” if that weren't enough, unrelenting work rate makes him a constant threat without the puck, too. his off-the-puck pace, in particular, stands out as a distinctly positive quality. “when he doesn't have the puck, he's shoulder checking in the defensive zone,” our lead scout rachel doerrie remarked in a game report. “in the offensive zone, he hunts it like a dog on a bone. it's fantastic to watch, and will be very effective at the next level.” he's one of the draft's legitimate dual-threat scorers. the data that eliteprospects dir. of north scouting collected from play at the u18s has him calibrated as more of a playmaker than a sniper, though. there are some goal-scorer's tools in toolbox. he's a net-front driven forward with a real knack for pouncing on loose pucks and banging rebounds home. he draws from a wide array of releases, employing the one-timer, catch-and-release, and two-touch shots, sometimes with a little blade deception, too. for all of projectable offensive components, perhaps no part of his game is quite as reﬁned as his in-zone defensive play. he reloads high early, doesn't cheat, uses his reach to steal pucks, consistently scans for threats, and is an unrelenting physical force along the boards. we have to broach limitations as well though. that conversation starts with his skating. he's hardly moving like a mark 1 tank at the battle of the somme, but upright skating stride with a lack of limb bend limits his explosiveness in space. for all of his plus-level habits to manoeuvre in small area scenarios, just isn't all that dynamic with the puck either. to credit, he's aware of his limitations, and he plays within them. there's something to be said for that level of self-awareness at an age where that's not an especially common trait. give it some time and has the potential to play as a no. 2 centre in some lucky lineup. he's going to take tough matchups, feature in both phases of special teams, and bring more than his fair share of secondary offence to the table. was a victim of the shut down last season. while he did play some games for a lower league in switzerland, he looked most dominant at the world under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games. there is a lot to like about game. at 6'2, 207, he is already physically mature. at 17, he scored 29 goals in the last season, showing he has some great natural goal-scoring ability. has an excellent shot and he is incredibly creative offensively. what makes stand out in comparison to other players with similar skill sets is his drive and competitiveness. he rarely gives up on plays and is tenacious on the forecheck. loves crashing the net and putting himself in tough areas to create scoring opportunities. the combination of both skill, competitiveness, and tenacity puts as a potential top 10 candidate in this year's draft and his overall package stands out. some scouts have some concerns over skating. while he may not have the top-end speed of other prospects, his game doesn't primarily rely on it to succeed. his top speed looks high enough to not be a detriment at the nhl level. projects as a top-six forward at the nhl and is likely a year to two years away from competing for a roster spot.\n",

            " has the tools that can make you easily envision him in the nhl. he has a thick 6-foot-2 frame and can skate like an nhl player. with his size and speed he can overpower opponents to force turnovers or in how he attacks the net and it makes him an asset on the pk. can create with his skating and skill, but his main offensive weapon is his shot. he can pick corners from distance with a powerful wrist shot. i didn't love his playmaking early on but that part of his game grew on me as the season went on especially how he made passes on the move. i see a potential very good top-six forward whether at or the wing with a chance to pop and become a true top-of-the-lineup type. as the season progressed, athletic build and pro-built game pushed him from projected first-rounder to top-10 consideration for some teams. and while i'm not quite there, the appeal is obvious. has always been a net-focussed shooter but he has worked to turn himself into a net-driven one, playing a more intentional game that knows what it is. on the puck, he uses inside body positioning to get to the middle off the cycle or the rush. off of it, he finishes his checks and looks to help his line get it back. i wouldn't say he's a menacing power forward type, but he has learned to play a very engaged, imposing, speed game. a decently-smooth skater and despite his heavy skew toward shooting and goals, i find he sees the ice well, hits seams when they're there, and makes a lot of short little plays as a passer off the wall (including off his backhand). his greatest strength is his catch-and-release. he can sling it. i do think he shoots a bit too much (a lot of his shots miss the net or are taken from low-percentage areas), but you can live with that and that should drop out as he gets even strong over his nhl frame. he's a favourite among scouts for the readymade projectability of his tools and his ability to put the puck in the net. though played mostly the wing at the national he's set to play centre at next season and several nhl clubs that interviewed him at the scouting combine believe that's where he's best suited. nhl central scouting director dan marr believes isn't far off the consensus top three in this draft of wright, slafkovsky and cooley, and that's not an uncommon belief, so this ranking puts me in the minority (i'd consider him in the fringes of the top 10 but not top five) although does have the ability to play both wing and his overall game may be suited more to a left-wing role at the next level. his ability to use his stride and his speed to break out wide and fly past defenders in the offensive zone. this season has seen suited to a predominantly left-wing role, which has allowed him to focus on being a little more offensively inclined, as his point totals and overall play in the o-zone has certainly showed. overall, there is a lot to like about entire game. he can be relied upon to get the job done in every single role he's cast into and is certainly in the minds of his opponents whenever his skates touch the ice. if he can simply fine tune some of the “rough around the edges” aspects to his game mentioned above, as well as continue his developmental path, he'll be a force to be reckoned with in the not-so-distant future. in terms of his draft position, teams with multiple first-round picks (ari, buf, mtl) may be hoping is still on the board when their other selections are on the clock. look for to be a mid to late first-rounder this coming july. though he played wing a lot this season, nhl teams – and himself – see him as a at the next level. he is expected to be a at where he will go next season. when you include that context, there's a reason he's been one of the biggest risers on draft boards across the league. at 6-foot-3, closing in on 200 pounds, he's a sturdy player with high-end goal-scoring ability and one of the most surehanded players in this draft. the puck stays glued to his stick in a way that i haven't found too common among players at this age. he has a huge pass radius, too, which allows him to collect pucks with a high level of success and turn them into shots or make good decisions to keep plays alive. is also an incredibly aggressive player off the puck. he uses his body well to protect or take away pucks. there are some scouts who think he could play in the league as soon as 2022-23 but would be fine if he spent more time developing in especially since he needs more reps at he does a lot of things well and now that teams are convinced he can be a at the next level, don't be surprised to see him go especially high in this draft. a power forward with good feet and a heavy release. can play all three forward positions, is smart defensively, and can hurt you on the special teams. if a team believes he can play the middle - which i think he can, then he won't last long on draft day. there's something to be said for a complementary player who excels in that role, and is that player in the 2022 nhl draft. every line he plays on is better for having him on it. it's the versatility that really stands out in this regard. there isn't a single role or task that the coaching staff can't assign to with some degree of confidence that he'll rise to the occasion. he can play any forward position, is every bit as enthusiastic about the defensive details as he is finding the scoresheet, is an absolute menace on the forecheck, and boasts a nice set of hands and a lethal shot. that shot is the basis of offensive projection to the next level, though. you don't score at nearly a goal a game clip against competition without a wicked release and his qualifies. he pushes his hands in front of his body, elevates his top elbow, and powers through the lever-action release on his wrist shot. it's easily an above-average nhl-lev-el tool as currently constructed. you couple that release with the soon-to-be forward's willingness to play the net-front and an almost preternatural knack for being in the spot at the time, and the projection only gets that much better. which, of course, says nothing of his ability to steal possession with his physicality or a well-timed stick lift. there is some playmaking skill in game to go along with that finishing touch, but it's hardly his selling point. he's a dextrous distributor, capable of feathering the puck through numbers with any pass for the occasion, but he lacks the high-level sense or planning to project as a top-flight playmaker at the next level. not at this stage in his anyway. his skating probably falls in that same range -- about an average if not slightly better projection. covers plen-ty of ground, but his upright stance limits his explosiveness and takes away from his ability to shield the puck. overall, though, there's a lot to like. you go through our reports, and you'll sense an early appreciation for his game from our group that only got stronger with each viewing. first, looked like a mid-round pick. then, by de-cember, a mid-first-rounder. now, a player just outside of our top-10, and one that we could easily see going a fair bit higher than that come july 6th in montréal. it's easy enough to understand why the league's power brokers might have an even greater affinity for game, too. we may see him as more of a skilled grinder with finishing ability than a pure power forward in the throwback mould, but there's more than a handful of teams out there who go in the opposite direction of us in their assessment of his game. on the low-end, is going to be that middle-six winger with the ability to play anywhere in the lineup that coaches just love to have on their roster; the high-end, a top-line power forward capable of taking over a game or a playoff series. time will tell where he lands on that spectrum. is a player that matured and progressed as the season went along. he jumped up my list rather quickly and solidified himself in my top 10. biggest weapon is his shot. his wrist shot is heavy, accurate, and powerful. the combination of his size and shot make for a formidable offensive weapon. he is an above-average skater as well and he proved last season he can play in all situations. can score down low, using his size to protect the puck or rip one from the face-off dots. this ability will be appealing to teams early in the draft. solid season means he is a potential top 10 in this year's draft. projects as a top-six forward at the nhl level. he is likely 1-2 years away from nhl duty. is a power forward with higher-end skill than your average player of his cut. he makes his presence felt on every shift, throwing his body around and getting involved in every scrum he can. he has the ability to drive transitional play, which is a trait that scouts will value highly. he has impressive puck-handling skills for a player who plays a power game and has above-average skating ability that allows him to keep up with a higher pace of play. he has risen up the ranks all season because of his ability to get to the high-danger scoring areas and use his nhl-caliber shot to beat goalies with a high consistency rate. he has positional flexibility as well, playing both the wing and down the middle. although he's more comfortable on the wing, it's a nice insurance policy knowing that he is capable of playing multiple positions. he's not an overly flashy player, and won't make any jaw-dropping one-on-one moves that bring the crowd to the edge of their seats, or even out of it. but what he will do is pick up the puck, stick his head down and drive the lane to create a quality primary scoring chance for himself or a second-chance opportunity for a teammate. if there were any issues or concerns with his game, it's his consistency. one night he will look like the best player on the ice and a go-to threat for his team, but on another he will blend into the crowd a little too much and be a passenger when he's on the ice. this can easily be fixed as he develops and matures more with age. is the one player who could very well go earlier than people expect because of his attributes and the fact that nhl teams really value the rare combination of skills that this player possesses.\n",

            " had a big draft season that generated a fair amount of discussion in scouting circles. he put up big scoring numbers, including great shot numbers, generating shots at the pace of the best prospects in this class such as nico hischier and owen tippett. he is a tall, strong forward who works hard to win pucks, and his ability to win battles is a plus attribute. he has above-average puck skills and can make plays in open ice. is often tagged as a goal scorer, with a very good shot that helped him be one of the top scorers in the this season. however, he is also a smart player who gets his chances through good reads and getting to the spots on the ice. i've also seen him make nice passes and smart reads that help his team maintain possession. the big problem with is that he has anvils for feet, and it's his skating that causes a lot of debate on his long-term value. is a big, strong, and opportunistic goalscoring winger. his skating stride is balanced and allows him good lateral agility, although his top speed is just average. has excellent passing ability, and is patient and poised while the puck is on his stick. he possesses a great shot, with strong velocity that he likes to use early and often. his puckhandling is above-average, especially for a powerforward, showing quick decision-making and using his body effectively. once he's in the offensive zone he's hard to contain, thanks to his large frame and strong stance, making him tough to push off the puck or out of position. he is highly effective in front of the net, setting screens for shots and jamming in loose pucks around the crease. he uses his large frame to battle along the boards and this hard work often produces a couple of really good chances on net per game. can dictate play with his size and net drive, and he does a good job controlling the puck on the outside with a long reach and above-average puck skills. his biggest strength is that he's a shot generator. does an excellent job finding holes in the offensive zone to receive passes and get off a quick release. he isn't just a one trick pony - he's a relentless forechecker who suffocates his man until he forces a turnover. he has some solid power-forward potential at the nhl level and is someone we would not be surprised to see go a lot higher than where we have him ranked, based on projected upside. offensive play can often be overshadowed by his poor defensive zone play. he is often slow to get back and when he does he seems almost lost positionally. he often floats near the top of the circles waiting for the breakout pass and rarely engages in retrieving the puck in this zone. it is strange to see the amount of effort he puts in keeping and regaining possession of the puck in the offensive zone and then the complete lack of interest in getting involved in battles in the defensive zone. he will never be a speed burner as his skating has some deficiencies and he struggles to gain separation from his opponents. is a high-end talent but he needs to continue to improve defensively, improve his speed and learn to consistently dictate at the level.\n",

            " a former elite prospect for many years, season was upended from several injuries to his lower body and back. even when he was playing, he was at 50 percent at the best of times. has great instincts, constantly finding seams to get the puck to his teammates or on net. \"he never wows you,\" said one scout, \"but he's always around the puck, making a good play.\" is a quality defensive forward with great work ethic in battles and solid overall positional play. he doesn't shy away from throwing a hit, and is strong on the puck. his skating isn't superb, but i thought it was decent prior to this season, with the injuries possibly accentuating the issues. he has the tools to be a top-six forward in the nhl, but there are big risk factors attached to making him a first-round pick as well. i'm banking on a recovery and a return to top form next season, but he's clearly one of this class' biggest wild cards. is a strong, pro-style player who plays a sound, two-way, reliable game. he has a strong lower half that allows him to generate healthy amounts of speed. he is very sound in the fundamental areas of the game that require a mix of power and agility. he is a confdent puck carrier and effcient distributor of the biscuit. shot is hard and quick, and really effective down low. he has some defnite fair and quickness in his hands that he uses to fool his opponents, although he favors the no-nonsense north-south power game that keeps the pressure cooker cranked up on opponents. he has a good motor, and is a competitor who wants the puck on his stick and knows what to do when he gets it. he loves to be “the guy,” but he is not all that electrifying and doesn't make many plays in the offensive zone that pull fans to the edge of their seats. he has a strong drive and can quickly fnd his teammates, dishing off before going to the crease. is strong in the offensive zone without the puck, disrupting puck movement and getting physical in battles for position. on the forecheck, he gets a bead on the defenseman with the puck and hits him hard to separate him from the puck before getting it in around the slot for a chance. is a very good defensive player who always seems to be in the spot and on top of his man with the puck. he backchecks hard and has a good idea of what lanes he needs to be in. he uses his stick well and commonly has a good angle on his man so that he can deliver a solid hit. injury derailed draft year and put some doubt in the minds of more than a few scouts as to if he would develop as many thought he would after going frst overall in the bantam draft. his work ethic and heart cannot be questioned, but his hockey iq leaves some questions. we sometimes question his thought process in the offensive zone without the puck. sometimes, makes decisions that limit his ability to generate offensive chances. he doesn't always take advantage of the gaps afforded him or skate himself out of options. we are hoping this is a product of the rust he played with this season due to long stretches of sitting out with injury and not the real .\n",

            " is a well-rounded winger who has almost every nhl attribute you want other than the size at 5-foot-11. he brings skill and speed to his shifts, showing the ability to carry the puck up ice and create chances for himself and his teammates. can pass the puck very well, but his shot is his main weapon. you can set him up from mid-range and he can finish. he lacks size, but he plays hard, showing no fear of engaging physically to win back pucks or to take a hit to make a play. he projects as a very good top-six winger who will score a lot of goals in the nhl. after exploding out of the gate to lead in scoring through the first third of the season, production hit a bit of a wall in the second half with jyp, a bottom-0f-the-table team. some of that had to do with poor puck luck (his shot generation remained high), some of it was a reduction in his ice time, and some of it was just the reality that he wasn't going to be a point-per-game producer in his draft year. he helped assuage some doubts with a six-goal, eight-point u18 worlds performance (though i thought he came and went in the middle of group play, he was excellent in the medal round). remains one of the more gifted individual creators in this draft class. he's a slick, play-creating winger who excels in possession, carves teams up through coverage to take the play from the flanks to the interior, and possesses quick, light hands. those tools enable him to take advantage of his dangerous wrister, which he can get off quickly from a variety of stances and at a variety of tempos. on the puck, he's agile through cuts and changes of direction and plays an intentional, attacking style. off of the puck, he also plays with a lot of energy and doesn't shy away from the physical side of the game, which has endeared him to coaches despite his 5-foot-11 frame. i'd like to see him slow down and utilize his linemates a little better than he does as he's actually a heady playmaker, but part of what makes him so exciting is his insistence on creating his own looks (even if that comes with some forcing it) with that shot of his. he really can sling it, with a wrister and one-timer that both pop. second line winger, who can be a threat on a nhl power-play. a high-scoring winger who put up impressive numbers over the first half of the season before being slowed by injuries in the second half, has a lot of the tools you're looking for in a top-six winger. he has one of the best overall shots among the top tier of this draft class and has higher-end puck skills that allow him to beat defenders 1-on-1 and create better scoring opportunities for himself. at the u18 worlds, he took over games at times in leading to a bronze medal. he's defensively responsible for his position and never quits on pucks. his skating is pretty good as he's shown some ability to separate, but i don't think he's a natural burner. he's best in the offensive half of the ice and can be a high-end scorer at the next level with a top-six ceiling. if everything goes you could make a case that he has top-line scorer potential. a high-end finisher with a top-notch one-timer, was filling the nets early, but an injury threw a wrench in things and he never refound his shine. he's going to need to simplify things and find chemistry with a space maker and distributor to max out. nothing about profile coming into the season really screamed top-five pick, but that's exactly where he found himself on most public boards by december. a hot start to the scouting season at the hlinka-gretzky cup and a productive first few months with jyp jyvaskyla in play will do that for a player. by the time team called on him for the world juniors, had amassed 18 points in 23 games, good for a 0.78 point-per-game clip -- the fourth-highest scoring rate among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the last 20 years over a full season. the shoulder injury that the 5-foot-11 winger sustained in the weeks leading up to the world juniors eventually caught up with him, though, and the production started to suffer as a result. it took 10 games to find the scoresheet upon rejoining jyp in january, and he only managed six points total in the final 16 games of the season. neither segment of season is especially indicative of the player's quality, though. he wasn't quite as exceptional as his gaudy point totals might've suggested through the first few months of the season and nowhere near as inept as his muted point totals in the back nine of the season would have his detractors believe. however boring this may sound, true talent level probably lies somewhere between those two blocks of his season. you can even see as much reflected in the statistics. there were signs in the underlying data that elite prospects dir. of european scouting lassi alanen tracked that the jyp winger benefited from percentage inflated totals, but you would also expect someone with so potent a shot and soft hands to outperform their expected shooting percentage. eventually, regression occurred, and we were with a clearer picture of the player in question. now, about that shot. it's easily one of the best in the class. there are only four players in our database of hundreds for this year's draft with a 7-grade as a shooter, and is one of them. he's one of a select few players who can credibly threaten as a shooter from intermediate-to-long range consistently. is most comfortable firing the outside-leg wrister, pushing his hands in front of his body, generating the desired downforce, shifting his weight appropriately, and snapping the puck on goal. that our partners at instat had him down for starts to make a whole lot of sense when you see the way he slings the puck out there. it's not enough to just have shooting skills, though. the game's best goal scorers all find ways to stack the odds in their favour with crafty off-puck movement. and gets it. he anticipates pockets of space well, arrives as the puck does for shooting op-portunities, positions his body in the best way to catch and release each pass, and generally seems well-connected to his teammates during sustained offensive zone possessions. he's always involved in the play. you'll never mistake for a retrieval artist either, but he's shown some forechecking skill and physicality across many of our viewings, too. he doesn't need someone else to do the dirty work to make things happen. and as someone with an above-average skating stride, hands, and puck protection mechanics -- can make something happen every time he secures possession. the problem with , of course, is that he's often a little too aware of his handling and shooting ability. his skills are closer to average than high-end, but he sometimes plays with the confidence of connor mcdavid anyway. the result is a lot of low percentage shots, turnovers, and missed passing opportunities. he can be downright infuriating to watch at times, more so than just about any other player in the top half of our first round. unlocking the best in at the next level should be a pretty straightforward exercise, and there's a nice package of skills there to work with. add a gear to his skating stride, introduce more manipulative patterns in his small-area game, and you're looking at a low-end top-six shoot-first forward. if nothing else, a long and fruitful career as a middle-six power play specialist is likely in the cards. burst onto the scene this season in scoring at a torrid pace and looking to smash some records in the country's top league for teenagers. however, his game cooled off significantly in the second half of the season and he struggled at times to create offense. regardless, 15 goals for a draft-eligible player competing against men is no small feat. goal-scoring is clearly greatest strength. he has an excellent wrist shot and loves to set up for one-timers on the powerplay. is a volume shooter and finds ways to get to open ice to create scoring opportunities with ease. he doesn't have high top speed, but he has an excellent first step which gives him time and space in the offensive zone. will need to work on his overall consistency and will likely need at least two years of extra before being nhl-ready. he projects as a top-six winger at the nhl level. is a talented forward who shot up draft boards to his incredible hot streak to start the season. the first thing is evidently clear about his game is his stellar puck skills. his hands set him up for success and has even seen him embarrass professional competition at select moments. additionally, he possesses what most would argue is a top-5 shot in the draft class. he is also a fine skater. he can generate speed quickly, which allows him to be effective at transitioning from defense to offense. even better, his forechecking is always a quality trait due to his stellar acceleration and strong edges. these tools also help in the defensive zone, allowing him to close in on opposing defensemen quickly, pressuring them into mistakes. in the defensive zone, his positioning is fairly adequate but his inactive stick in these instances does allow for plays to be made at the blue line. the other concern for him is how effective his offense is outside of his sniping ability. he is sometimes seem primarily as a perimeter player who benefited from his strong shot and some lucky bounces to inflate his scoring. he's not particularly strong, either, so driving towards the net is not something he does at a frequent enough pace. however, a lack of strength should be expected for a draft-eligible playing in a top professional european league. given time and the this is an element that shouldn't have long-term concern, and his strong skating and elite shot make a solid prospect worthy of his draft position. could, too, outperform that draft slot should he develop a more well-rounded offensive attack to compliment his shot and stay as an average defensive talent.\n",

            " is a very well-rounded who has no noticeable flaw in his skill set but there also isn't a ton about his game that gets you overly excited. he can skate and handle the puck like an nhler. game translates because of his compete and direct style of play. he takes pucks to the net and plays quick. he can pull up to make a tough pass but can take pucks to the interior too. he has the high-end vision to run a power-play unit and make tough plays with pace. his shot is very good, showing the ability to pick corners from long range consistently. off the puck he's competitive and responsible, showing maturity beyond his years. he projects as a no. 1 in the nhl due to his all-around play with a chance to be a star, but probably won't be an elite scorer in the league. still my top prospect in this class (though no longer in a tier of his own), is an athletic kid who boasts a wide gait and boxy shoulders that balance him over pucks. those physical tools are complemented by a lethal wrist shot release (which he can get off from several stances and pops off of his blade's heel or toe) and quick hands in traffic that allow him to take pucks off of the wall and create scoring chances to the interior. he's also one of the most diligent three-zone players in the draft, with a powerful stride that helps him push play up ice (though its power is more evident the length of the sheet than from a standstill into a quick foot race) when he's done providing support low in his zone or above the puck. while his shot is his biggest weapon inside the offensive zone (i actually think he was owed a few more goals than his 35 on 290 shots this season gave him), he played a much more creative game inside the offensive zone into the second half. he blends versatile skill with a heady, detailed game that will allow him to drive a line and be relied upon in all situations down the middle at the next level. there are times when scouts want to see him play with a little more fire and feistiness to really take over games and impose himself on the forecheck/in battles more, but his eye for detail off the puck puts him in a supportive role more often than an active chase and that's fine. i would have liked to see him hang onto the puck a little more this season, but he played with talented linemates where his ability to play into their strengths and execute off of give-and-go's worked. he's got pro tools and projects as an impactful top-six centre. he may not become a point per game player, but i see 30-goal, 70-point upside at a premium position. the complicated and essential question to answer is, “what does this all mean looking forward?” there is no doubt that attention to detail style of play combined with intelligent and quick decision-making is the start of a valuable foundation for him to continue to build on as he progresses into the nhl. however, that package of skills and habits will only take him so far when he advances to play against more intelligent and faster competition. in the he infrequently shows off his high octane offense, which reasonably has caused doubts about his offensive ceiling. at this moment in time, it is likely premature to value these concerns heavily enough to knock him off the top spot in the 2022 draft class. however, if these question marks around his offensive contributions still exist in july, it would be warranted to consider how his game will project to the nhl and if that assessment leads to a consensus 1st overall player. the expectation for (or any prospect for that matter) should not be to save the franchise or to be a generational talent, as he will most likely disappoint. a reasonable projection for would be in the range of a low-end 1st line to a high-end 2nd line which to some may sound pessimistic in the context of 1st overall. still, it is an essential piece to have on a successful team and is not easy to acquire. in addition, will likely benefit from being paired with skilled wingers, who can allow to focus on pushing play up ice to the offensive zone where his linemates can flourish. finally, with his shot, he will surely be a continual threat on the powerplay, where he has consistently shown he can score from many angles and distances. with high-end hockey sense highlighted by his tremendous offensive intelligence, can make a lot of plays. while he lacks a dynamic puck skills in terms of handling, he has one of the better shots in this draft class with a quick, deceptive release. though he has often been compared to patrice bergeron, i think is a good two-way player but not to the degree where that is an especially apt comparison. he does a lot of the things you hope a does in terms of puck possession, making plays and contributing in his own end. the offensive elements of his game are the standout traits for me. my biggest concern with to date is the general lack of progression in his game year over year, with the full knowledge that he missed an entire season. while i think he should be graded on a curve as a result, it is harder to know just how much that lost season impacted his long-term projection. hockey sense is a separating factor from most of his peers and he clearly has that competitive drive that allow him to win a lot of battles. in the end, i think does just about everything well. his hockey sense and his shot are high-end-to-elite traits, he has terrific vision and spots plays with the best of them, but the lack of a dynamic element to his play is what gives me the most concern aside from his progression. i have been waiting all season to see a player who looks like he should be a no. 1 nhl draft pick, and i did not feel his ceiling is at the same level as slafkovsky's or cooley's. is the safer pick of all three in that i think he has the highest floor of any of those three players and possesses an nhl-ready game. i don't think he's done developing and there's plenty of potential for him to still reach for, but my concern is that he's closer to plateauing than the other two players. i'm not convinced that's true yet, but it's definitely in the back of my mind as i rank these players because, to me, all three are very close. the top player from the class held this position from tip to tail on my board. is a highly intelligent pivot who boasts a heavy release, deft passing touch, and the wherewithal to package those tools into their situations. he lacks the separation speed you'd like from an elite centre but makes up for it with his nuanced understanding of the game. can connect plays, drive action, dish it or finish it, and thwart plays against. he's going to be good. in a draft year shaped by substantial depth rather than overwhelming star power, it's almost fitting that the least exciting option at first overall is the one. better still, the one, if you'll allow us that clunky pun. that would end up in that spot may have seemed like a foregone conclusion a year or two ago, but the gap year that the lost 2020-21 season forced on (and countless others) him slow out of the gates. two months of good-not-great production was enough to make the question of the first overall pick an open one for many in the industry, with new answers emerging first in the form of logan cooley and then later in juraj slafkovsky. in time, though, reminded the scouting community of his quality, ending many (not all…) of those conversa-tions emphatically. the 1.15 point per game clip that he ran through october and november turned to 1.36 by the end of the calendar year. from there, it just kept climbing until had amassed 94 points in 63 regular season contests by the season's end, good for a 1.49 point per game clip. it's still the lowest draft year points per game mark of any first overall pick out of the this side of rick nash in 2001, but a more selective and perhaps representative sample from december onward gets to 1.63 points per game. that's more than nico hischier in 2017 and ryan nugent-hopkins in 2011, for context. shifting our focus from the question of how many to how, is this draft's premier play-connector; an on-ice ad-ministrator through which his team's offensive and defensive sequences flow. by constantly surveying the ice, maintains a mental map of his surroundings with a downright topographical level of detail. he knows the position of his teammates like they're a long-established fact rather than a dynamic, changing set of options on the playing field, and moves the puck to them with a matching level of confidence. look-off passes, the give-and-go, one- and two-touch passes, reach-adjusted passing -- mastered every one of these tools en route to becoming one of the game's best playmaking centres not currently in the nhl. his cunning as a distributor with a high-level shot (even if it's a little peculiar from a mechanical perspective) that's especially potent off of the pass and some of the best hands in the class. he's the complete package offensively. we would, of course, feel better about shot if he used it a little more judiciously rather than settling for low percentage attempts under pressure, but that's a minor quibble for as scalable an offensive toolkit as you'll find in this class. then there's his play in the defensive zone. de-fensive reads, angles, and support play are beyond reproach. there may not be an art ross in his future, but the frank j. selke seems well within reach. we don't make the patrice bergeron comparison lightly, after all. all of these factors combined to make the consensus first overall pick for the elite prospects scouting staff. you just don't come across many players this polished or this well-rounded at 18-years-old, and that's too much to pass up on if you're holding the first pick in this july's draft. has been on the radar of scouts for a long-time now. he received exceptional status to play in the as a 15-year-old and put up amazing numbers at the time. unfortunately, he did not play last season because of covid restrictions in ontario. despite the missed time, captained to an under-18 gold medal in 2021 and put up 94 points this season. is potentially the most well-rounded player in the draft. he does everything really well, in all zones. he plays a mature game and has strong leadership qualities. originally looked like more of a goal-scorer in his 15-year-old season, but he has rounded out his playmaking as well in the past year or so. he finished top 10 in scoring. biggest asset is his shot and his ability to generate scoring opportunities. he can drive a line on his own, making him a potential number one at the nhl level. some scouts question his offensive ceiling for a potential number one pick, but he could easily put up 30 goals and 70 points at the nhl level with regularity. should jump into full-time nhl duty next season. is an elite two-way with incredible offensive ability. it's not often you watch players where you really struggle to find too many weaknesses at this level, but he has been that way for a while now. his intelligence on the ice is second-to-none and on full display in his playmaking, his lane pursuit, and his awareness. adds a pro caliber shot to his toolbox that will allow him to be a multi-dimensional offensive threat at the nhl level, sooner rather than later. he's so mature in his defensive game and because of that, he is just as effective defensively as he is offensively. he knows the nuances of playing the position and can properly support his defenders on every play. he never seems to be caught out of position and remains engaged and effective on both the rush and the cycle. the biggest issue with game this season was his inconsistent offensive production. through the christmas break, he wasn't producing the way a top-tier draft eligible prospect would in the but he put most of the questions about his production to rest with his amazing second-half explosion. there was an odd amount of discourse surrounding stature as the top player in this class given the way his season went. while it wasn't completely unwarranted, it is important to remember he missed essentially the entire 2020-21 season due to the pandemic, and had insane expectations coming off his rookie season. the way rebounded in the latter half of the year showed enough to remind people why he can be a future top-line in the nhl for years to come and why he is considered the odds-on favorite to be the number one selection in the nhl draft.\n",

            " strengths come with the puck on his stick. he's a very smart puck-moving defenseman with a solid skill level. he has the vision and poise to make great outlets and find seams in the offensive zone. shows the stick skills to put pucks through legs on occasion. he lacks speed to rush pucks but his stick and brain let him transition well. he also has a hard point shot allowing him to be dangerous on the power play. his skating leads to some defensive issues and he may need to be a guy in the nhl who doesn't take tough matchups. i think he will play in the nhl but he may need to be used in a specific way. was the first pick in the 2020 draft and looked like a surefire first-rounder through the youth olympics (where he was an alternate captain) and into his strong rookie season in the (where he won the league's defensive rookie of the year award). and while it took him some time to get back to that status after a knee procedure cost him his summer, his preseason, and the first three games of the regular season, he hit his stride in the second half and into gatineau's two-round playoff run, logging huge all situations minutes and contributing offensively while playing a matchup role against the opposition's best. game isn't dynamic, but he's a smooth-skating (without being explosive, something some scouts worry about) right-shot defenceman who can competently run a power play, is a plus-level passer, has developed his shot into more of a weapon, and reads the play at as high a level as just about any defenceman in the draft (with and without the puck at both ends). he plays a cerebral two-way game that lends itself to driving play. and while he's a high-floor, low-ceiling type, his size, maturity, roundedness and discreet offensive game and skating (both of which i expect will show themselves more next season with full health and a summer of steady training) should make him an efficient, all-purpose guy. if works on his skating and keeps a conservative strategy when controlling the puck, i believe that his projection is a third pairing defenseman. but, if can adopt a more creative style to puck control, grow his scanning abilities and further develop his skating, his upside only trends upwards. i just want to see attack in the offensive zone with passes to medium and high danger. while does pass to medium and high danger, he doesn't do it with much regularity. he needs to continue to grow his puck manipulation to open up space for himself and not revert to low danger shots. i'd like to see him grow more of an inside game and challenge more. if he does do so, then second pairing upside is possible. with 43 points in 63 games this season, continued on the path of showcasing he can be a solid two-way defenseman. his offensive tools are better than what he does defensively. the more i watched this season, i just felt like there was good-enough offensive skill and adequate defending. he did everything at a level that didn't strike me as truly elite or high-end, but he did a lot of things well. we had high expectations for coming into the season, hoping that we would see nothing short of offensive dominance at the level. to some degree, we got that from the gatineau olympiques defenceman. he continued to show the same agility and ability to feint and pass around opponents this season. his elusive skating moves were especially effective on regroups and at the point in the offensive zone, where opponents came at him with speed. with heel-to-heels and spins, easily outmaneuvered them to attack or pass down the ice. much of his production came from his ability to create offensive zone entries and passes to teammates around the net. that said, his breakout game us wanting more. his offensive zone playmaking never translated to that aspect of the game. with his back turned to forechecking pressure, as he retrieved a puck, seemed to lose his composure. quite often, he defaulted to rims and chips off the glass, even with open teammates ready for a pass in the middle of the ice. while is very agile, his speed and quickness ranked significantly below average this season; his heavier stride didn't allow him to create as much separation from opponents. once he slowed down to get a puck on the back wall of the defensive zone, his escape routes became more limited. but lesser offensive showing this season can't all be attributed to mechanical and decision-making problems, he also seemed to purposely scale back that facet of his game this season in favour of developing a more sound defensive game. “this was one of the most physical and defensively engaged performances i've seen from ,” elite prospects scout david st-louis wrote on march 19th, 2022. 'it may have had to do with this game being the first of ève gascon in the gatineau olympiques uniform. he defended the front of the net fiercely, ramming and shoving opposing attackers away from her sight.” if continues to hone his off-puck plays and improves the efficiency of his forward stride, he could find a role as a bottom-pairing defenceman in the nhl in a few years. his agility and playmaking talent could lend themselves to a power play role, too. two-way defender has some questions regarding offensive upside. overall has a solid toolkit and is likely to play nhl games. is a calm and self-assured defender that exudes confidence in all three zones. his skating is silky smooth with fluid four-way mobility, good speed in transition, and the agility to manage pressure and escape into open ice. slick hands, strong and accurate passing, and great vision allow him to initiate zone exits, move pucks through the neutral zone and gain the offensive blue line. he can quarterback a power play, get shots to the net, shield pucks from the opposition and prolong offensive zone possession. in his own end, his positioning is first-rate and, although he isn't one to run around and bang into anything that moves, he can rub guys out along the wall, battle for pucks, and play a smart physical game when that is called for. he can be expected to continue to refine the little details of his play. his hockey iq is already high, but that will naturally continue to develop as he matures. his speed, specifically his quickness over short distances, is something that he is likely to address. directional changes, especially in his pivots, are a little choppy and he loses power in his stride due to being a little too upright in his stance. a correction would help make him more effective. having said that, all the elements of a premier defenseman are in place and, while he doesn't come with a top-pair guarantee, he is certainly not a gamble either. how well and how much of his skillset he can transfer to the next level will determine where he fits into the lineup, but there is little doubt that he is a future nhl defenseman. a team wanting to add a sound two-way game to their back end with offensive upside and the potential to blossom into a steady fixture on their top unit could see as exactly what they're looking for.\n",

            " has a clear nhl toolkit. he's a 6-foot-2 defenseman who can skate and has offensive abilities. he's able to carry pucks up ice well with his skating, and has excellent edgework to evade pressure. shows touch and vision with the puck to run a power play and create off the blue line due to his skill and feet. despite his size and skating, he's mediocre defensively. he doesn't compete that hard on that side of the ice and is overly aggressive offensively. that's a concern, but he generates so much offense that it makes up for those issues to an extent. projects as a top-four defenseman. long, smooth-skating, point-per-game defencemen never last long in the draft, and won't linger unpicked. i think he's in the same tier and conversation as mateychuk, even if he slots five spots lower. he was one of the most improved players in the draft this year as he settled into an ambitious, free-flowing game that reminded a little of stars first-rounder thomas harley at the same age, and his june birthday should give him even more runway next season. he handles the puck smoothly on his hip, his impressive footwork and maneuverability help him adjust to, away, and around pressure, and then he reads and anticipates the play at a high level so that he can make something happen out of all of his movement and carries. i like his stick and his ability to use his feet to defend the rush and disrupt play (though he's a better transition defender than a defensive zone one). his hallmark will always be his near-perfect posture and balance over his skates. he lives and dies trying to guide play with and without the puck with his mobility, pivots and directional changes. he can take over a game with his ability to transport the puck and roam. it was nice to see him look to attack into his shot (which isn't particularly hard) more in the playoffs. there's still some fine-tuning that needs to happen but my fourth-ranked d for a reason and a worthwhile pick as high as the fringes of the top 10. three questions i have about projectability: is he going to be able to control the pace of play at the nhl level? how will he adapt to a more physical league? how will he keep his composure when there is less time to make a decision? the nhl is a different beast entirely, and while some teams play an nhl style, there's a massive gap in the level of competition. these questions i have aren't going to make or break , but they're going to be points where he may struggle early on in his nhl career. with less time to make decisions, is going to have to react to plays quickly and maintain his composure. earlier in the season, i wouldn't have been convinced that could handle such challenges. after watching him for the entire season, however, he's proven that he's able to adapt and make changes quickly. has been a hotly debated player among the smaht scouting crew it's easy to see why people can be so divided on . the good parts about his game are very good, while the bad parts of his game can be very bad. if you're taking based on his upside, you'll have to be prepared for to take a few years in the ahl to develop. his game needs a lot of polishing both in the neutral and defensive zones, and the panic that can occasionally overtake him under pressure will need to be worked out as well. given time, however, can be a top four, maybe even top pairing defenseman capable of quarterbacking a power play unit. give him free rein and he'll become one of the better defensemen in the league. rein him in, and you're looking at a player that might not be as impactful in the nhl. admittedly, i was wrong about early on this year. i saw the occasional bad play and refused to see the entirety of his game. at this point, i'm confident that goes in the top 15 of the 2022 draft and it wouldn't surprise me if he sneaks into the top ten. as someone that has followed the hurricanes for a long time, reminds me a bit of joni pitkanen in the way that he plays in the offensive zone and noah hanifin in the way that he skates both in transition and on the blue line. will make a team very happy when they select him. one of the biggest risers all season, is still actively playing as we write this. he's in the championship series and, as a top-four defenseman for seattle, has had a large hand in getting them there. over the regular season, put up big points with 65 in 67 games. he moves pucks exceptionally well, jumps into plays with regularity and has shown an improved goal-scoring skillset in the postseason. he had four regular-season goals and as i write this had six in the playoffs in 22 games. is a bit on the lanky side now, but he's so co-ordinated and smooth. once he fills out, i think his defending will become more effective and he can hold his own better along the walls and in the tough areas of the ice. either way, a 6-foot-2 defenseman with fluid mobility and skills is an especially enticing option in the top half of the first round. i think he's got a great shot to be a top-four guy down the line. one of the most electric offensive defenders in the draft can make opponents look silly on the power play. can complete complex dekes before sending a bullet across a fold on the breakout. but he can also miss a target by two feet, get completely clowned on in his own end, and needs to be sheltered. big upside here, but nearly as big a risk. there is perhaps no greater gamble in the first round of this year's draft than defenceman . the seattle thunderbirds defenceman is about as high-risk, high-reward an option as you'll find. let's start with the reward part of the equation. that would be almost unparalleled ability in transition and the offensive zone. there's a reason the seattle thunderbirds blueliner led all first-time draft-eligible defenders in points with 65 through 67 regular season contests. “ breakouts follow the framework of the best breakout artists in the nhl: use the middle, draw pressure, and pass up the ice to the open teammate,” elite prospects dir. of north scouting wrote in a film room deep dive on . “but he doesn't just abide by the simple formula; he builds off it, reshaping breakouts to perfectly match his skill set. “most prospects use the middle lane sparingly. attacks it every touch with unwavering confidence. once he gets the first forechecker chasing, he skates directly at the next one. sometimes, he fakes them out with handling skill and dekes around them. “others, he passes under their stick for a long-range breakout pass. if neither is an option, he encourages the forechecker to reach, then he cuts back away from them before moving play to the inside. either way, the result is the same: he's beat two players, meaning there's an open teammate up the ice.” the results bear out quality on the breakout, with the thunderbirds blueliner rating in the 98th percentile as a transition player according to the data set that manually tracked throughout the season. many of the same elements that made him so effective on the breakout also reveal themselves in the way that drives play in the offensive zone. rare was the prolonged offensive zone sequence that didn't feature at least one blue line activation from the 6-foot-2 defenceman. and as was the case in transition, always worked from the outside in, collecting pucks along the boards and funnelling play towards the slot. “ game is built on individual skill,” wrote in a scout's notebook article on ep rinkside. “in the offensive zone, he's constantly working laterally; dragging defenders to the outside, cutting back, and heading back to the middle. he's both a shooter and a playmaker, playing off the threat of one to use the other.” the catch with is that you're not getting an especially refined defender. even that may be a charitable assessment. frankly, he's one of the worst off-puck defenders to land on the final elite prospects draft ranking, so incredibly puck-focused and out of most plays that the thunderbirds may as well have been down a man with on the ice during even strength defensive sequences. some of that will improve with even a slight uptick in his engagement level, but it's nonetheless concerning to see a draft-eligible defenceman so completely out of his depth as an in-zone defender. without significant to this part of his game, it's hard to imagine an nhl coaching staff having much appetite for playing in anything but a bottom-of-the-lineup role – if that. make no mistake: you're throwing caution to the wind a bit with a selection in the top half of the first round. there's a very real chance that his inability to defend coupled with a below-average skating stride conspire to spoil an otherwise promising career. even so, you can't let a player with this upside last much longer than that in this year's draft. is one of only a handful of players with power play quarterback, 40-plus points upside from the blue line, and that makes him well worth the risk. safe is death, right? started the season outside the first round on most draft lists. however, his stock climbed quickly with a stellar performance for seattle in the this season. averaging almost a point-per-game, plays a well-rounded offensive game. he moves the puck up the ice quickly to his teammates and has an excellent first pass. is an elite skater and loves to fly through the neutral zone. at 6'2, he has the physical tools to excel at the nhl level. he is excellent in transition. has a quick stick defensively and can neutralize play through his quick first step and strong positional awareness. he had a low goal total this season, which has some scouts question his offensive ceiling. however, his overall toolkit leaves teams a lot to work with, especially with his high-end passing ability. projects as a top-four defender at the nhl level. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. is one of the top offensive defensemen available in this year's nhl draft. he's a magnificent skater who will dazzle you with his edgework and crossovers as he patrols the offensive blue line. he does a fantastic job of working the puck on the blue line and getting it towards the middle of the ice to get a better shot towards the net. he's got a nice long stride and great acceleration, which allows him to retrieve pucks before anyone else. it also aids him in catching opponents off guard and closing the gap on them quickly. his puck-handling abilities are also a strong point of his game. if he gets the puck under pressure he's able to shake them off with a quick spin, head-fake or some nice stick work and dance around them. he's a solid passer who won't miss any open options, but he also has the odd turnover when an easy option isn't available, calling into question a little bit his ability or desire to keep things on the safer side at times. he is a highly intelligent player who plays at a high pace. while this is great when he or his team has the puck, when it comes to defending he can get a little over-zealous and lose his positioning. he also struggles at times when it comes to using his body to defend physically, though that's an element that may simply come with time. one-on-one battles become a struggle if he's not able to use his stick to strip someone. however, the good news with this is he has size and with lots of room on his large frame to beef up, which may help him tune the physical part of his game. showed this season he's got the potential to become a top-four defenseman in the nhl who could also contribute regularly on the power play.\n",

            " had a great season, scoring 36 goals and 80 points in 62 games, generating a lot of shots as a driving force for barrie even after ryan suzuki was traded. shot is the first thing scouts bring up. he has an absolute cannon. he can one-time from the circles and beat goalies clean, which is a highly desirable skill. is also a high-end passer who can find seams consistently, which combined with his shot, makes him very dangerous on the power play. the main issue with is his skating. his stride is awkward, he hunches over, it breaks down often and prevents him from being dangerous on entries. i debated between a 55 and a 60 for his puck skills. when you watch him in practice it's clear he has tremendous hands, and in games you can see it come out, but he rarely executes, which may be due to a lack of quickness and not a lack of skill. i don't see him as a physical player who will pk in the nhl, but he works on the ice and wins enough engagements. was a driver of offence on a team that needed it in barrie this season and he just kept getting better as the year went along. when it was all said and done, his 80 points ranked fifth among first-year draft eligibles in the i was particularly impressed by his second half when, after the colts dealt the bulk of their core, he continued to produce. he was also impressive at the top prospects game, where he made a trio of superb plays off the rush. he's an excellent shooter, particularly in catch-and-release scenarios in motion. after the colts traded ryan suzuki on jan. 10, went on a 13-game point streak to close out the season with 33 points in his final 25 games. i worry his skating and pace of play may not be high-end enough to reach his true potential, but if he can make some progress there, he's got the rest. like most notable goal-scorers, he's proficient around the net and has no issue finding the spot to plant himself in front of the crease to put pucks in the net. a solid scorer who gets up and down the ice well, navigates the offensive zone with great awareness and can work himself into good ice to create chances. he led the barrie colts in scoring by 33 points and surely would have bolstered a case for himself had there been a u18 world championship this year. is a late riser who had a nice performance at the top prospects game. he has a good variety of release points on his shot and can make plays off the pass. he's most comfortable setting up shop at the top of the face-off circle, taking cross-ice feeds, and one-timing them on net with thunderous force. scored 18 of his 35 goals with the man-advantage, connecting on 25 percent of his shots in that phase of play. that shooting percentage is a bit rich, even in a league where finishing talent can really move the needle but that just means he'll need to shoot even more next year to keep up that pace. it's still very much so a tool that i'd rate as nhl projectable. the colts primarily used as a centre, and he rewarded their faith with passing numbers commensurate with the top pivots. the data that collected from the and the in 2019-20 shows rating in the 96th percentile in expected assists per hour and the 89th percentile in shot assists per hour, both at 5-on-5. lnstat hockey, meanwhile, has leading the colts in passes to the slot, completing 33 such dishes -- that's eight more than the next highest barrie skater. they also have completing about 82 percent of his passes total. \"he sets up his feeds really well, scanning the ice for where his target will be, looking on the pass and threatening to shoot,\" remarked in a march game report. now for the bad, and if you're a master of working the process of elimination then i congratulate you on correctly assuming it's his skating. \"your group thinks is going to figure out his skating?\" one western conference scout asked me. curious about our rating. \"it's not good. i just wonder if he's going to figure it out.\" wei i, fair enough. finished the year with a 4-grade as a skater, and that's just not good enough to make it to the nhl. there are a lot of really enviable tools in toolkit; he's got one of the best shots in the draft, can see the ice well, and possesses plus-defensive instincts. \" skating remains a problem,\" remarked in a march game report. \"he doesn't even sniff a separation gear. he has no corrective or recovery ability -- and when he's not playing smart (which happens) he's a negative on the ice. when compounded with a lack of pace. the lack of speed killed him in transition. he was driven wide and forced to dump the puck in with no chance of a retrieval.\" if can figure his skating out, play smarter hockey, elevate his work rate, and just work on his consistency -- there's something there. we see him as a winger at the nhl level -- if he gets there -- with top-six upside and first-unit power play utility. it's just going to take a lot of work to get there. has bounced around my late first-round rankings this season and made the cut as a legitimate first-round candidate. had a steady offensive season and on a rebuilding barrie colts squad has taken the reigns offensively speaking. he's a that is coveted and has decent size and strength. he projects as a middle-six forward, with second-line upside. an offensively gifted who is an offensive threat with the puck on his stick. he's an agile skater with good edge work that can rapidly change direction and transition with the play. while he has solid foot speed and good power in his strides, he needs to work on his lower body strength to increase his acceleration though he can create speed through his transitions. has soft hand with the ability to make nice saucer passes and makes smart decisions when pressured. his shot is a bit underwhelming and could use more power, but he does possess a quick release and a willingness to shoot from anywhere in the offensive zone. he has a knack for finding open areas in the offensive zones and relies on his awareness to fight for space in open areas. he could put more effort into his forecheck and can't always keep up with the physical play as he doesn't seem to initiate contact often enough. defensively, his game could use work as his occasional lapses in positioning could mean he is better suited as a winger at higher levels. sometimes he gets caught with his feet planted in one position. he does have the ability to get open for his defenseman to put a pass back up the ice for an offensive rush. overall, he seems to communicate well with his teammates, often dictating the play and isn't afraid to get into a puck battle along the boards with his high compete level.\n",

            " is one of the best puck stoppers to come along since tampa bay prospect andrei vasilevsky was on the draft-eligible scene. he has good natural size; thick and strong build, not skinny, imposing in the crease for shooters. he moves well, fluidly getting around the crease. the big stopper is always square to the shot, in strong position and makes good use of his chest protector. he plays an assertive game with an established presence at the top of his crease. not terribly athletic, but does end up making some nice saves that show off his ability to get creative when the defense around him breaks down. he can stack the pads, use the poke check or rob a shooter with a quick glove save. he can also get his blocker on a wired puck and deposit it into the protective net or open corner. his rebound control is solid as well. he challenges shooters and is aggressive, taking away a lot of the net. but he is not so overly aggressive that it costs him. his reflexes and flexibility are admirable. he makes unconventional efforts to keep competing on plays. his calming nature and confidence are very notable and he bounces back from any goals allowed, showing a quick ability to forget and move on.\n",

            " is a very well-rounded defenseman. his puck game is great. he has the high-end brain to make a lot of tough plays often. can hit seams, make plays under pressure and makes a great outlet pass. he also shows individual skill which, when combined with good speed, allows him to be dangerous in transition too. defensively he's solid due to his skating, compete and brain, even though he's not imposing physically and can be trusted with tough responsibilities. projects as a top-pair defenseman. this kid turned 18 in the middle of february and he's already registered 65 points in 112 games at a professional level as a defenceman! statistical profile is as strong as any draft-eligible defenceman we've seen in recent years — and stronger than any player in this draft class. a poll of nhl scouts still gives czech defenceman david jiricek the slight edge, but i'd argue only further stamped what i believe to be the better case with his exceptional, record-setting play in nitra's playoff run and into the men's world championships. this is a kid who has looked a class above his peers whenever he's played with them, has excelled against nhlers on the senior stage, and is already a top player at his position in his top domestic league (albeit a difficult one to evaluate). is a calculated and poised three-zone defender who is capable of organizing play from the top of the zone, executing through seams in coverage at a high level, and starting and leading his fair share of rushes. he's got great edges and four-way mobility. and he also regularly flashes sneaky deception, which blends beautifully with his rare maturity for his age. though i wouldn't say he's a dynamic, game-breaking type offensively, i see plenty of calmness and talent, he knows when and how to push (and when and how to sit back and defend), he's already got pro size, he plays a polished game, and he's a righty. i expect him to become the best defenceman out of since zdeno chara and a true no. 2 (and maybe even no. 1) guy who plays an effective, efficient, play-driving modern game. the game just comes easy to him. with , you are netting a top pairing defender. while some of the report might scream that he is stronger offensively than he is defensively, he is well-rounded and well-adversed to defending the rush and neutralizing threats in his own zone. one of the very best passers in this draft, racked up a ton of assists this season with high-level vision and decisiveness with the puck on his stick. he finished with 26 points in 39 games in top pro league. the only u18 players to produce at a higher level at the same age as were forwards marian hossa and marian gaborik. and that was just the regular season. in the playoffs this year, had 17 points over the 19 games, by far a record in the league for a u18 player, though marian hossa's 1.43 points per game in the 1997 postseason will remain the high-water mark on a per-game rate. what did this year is largely unprecedented for a u18 defenseman. is clearly an intelligent offensive defenseman who defends at an average level. he is best with the puck on his stick, pushing pucks up ice and making plays. the offensive toolkit and offensive sense he possesses is clearly advanced for his age. his skating is at a high enough level and i think his overall hockey sense puts him among the top tier in this draft. that said, i think there are some limitations to his defensive game and there is a lot more he has to do to get detail in his game. he had a full green light it seemed at nitra, which is incredible confidence in a young guy, but we also got to see how often that could let him get out of position and create some headaches for his ‘d' partner. i think as he gets better at picking his spots, he could be a lethal offensive force for whichever team drafts him. i think he projects comfortably into a top-four role, but i just have a little more confidence in jiricek having a no. 1 defenseman ceiling compared to . the statistical comparables to draft year in the tipos extraliga are basically non-existent. he broke nearly every u21 record for defenders in the top slovak league and shone for his nation in most international events. is a right-shot kid with swagger and a mind for play creation. more of a problem-solver than a planner in transition, but has the tools to get away with it. he added creativity and shiftiness throughout the season. there's a top-pair upside here. šimon just put together the most productive draft year season from a defenceman in tipos extraliga history. in fact, marián hossa and marian gáborik are the only two other players in league history ever to best 26 points in 39 games as a first-time draft-eligible skater. some of that is survivorship bias in action. defencemen of quality don't usually play their draft year in the tipos extraliga; they fly for the czech extraliga or any other number of more challenging professional settings. the other part of the equation is that is just a really damn good hockey player. even a less difficult (all things be-ing relative) professional setting is still a professional setting, and he deserves a due of credit for the way he handled the assignment. it's not like hk nitra sheltered the 18-year-old slovak blueliner; his 20:15 a night in ice-time, according to our partners at instat, was third-highest on the team. how did pull it off? by constantly making the play at the time and rarely if ever deviating from his team's structure. you just won't find a more reliable, steady defenceman in this year's draft than . he isn't going to bring you out of your seat with any exhilarating displays of creativity or skill, but the trade-off is that he won't leave you shaking your head in disbelief at a poor decision or a costly turnover either. that posture isn't for a lack of skill or nhl-level tools. if anything, the opposite is true. we view as one of the draft's more toolsy defencemen, with above-average skating, handling, shooting, and passing skill. his one-timer is a veritable cannon. we also don't want you to get the idea that is strictly a stay-at-home defender either. while low percentage shots and an inability to create offensive advantages often marred our game reports for the 6-foot-1 blueliner, there was also a consistent appreciation for his offensive activations, be they on the rush or from the offensive blue line. he'll always take what's there. you would like to see that skill on the rush translate as a neutral zone defender, but that part of game is still a work in progress. a fairly accommodating gap and an inability to break down multivariable situations in space often conspired to leave the slovak defensive prospect help-less on the rush. his skating base and sense are such that should be able to iron out these parts of his game with time, but for now anyway, they represent something of an achilles heel in his game. overall, though, has one of the highest floors in this class. it's all too easy to imagine a scenario where he's playing top-four minutes in the nhl, featuring in both phases of special teams, and leveraging his tools and sense for consistently good-not-great points totals. any team would be happy to find such a player with a top-10 pick. risk management ability goes away, and on the breakout, where the forecheck can force him into imprecise passes. he has the patterns, but not the hockey sense to back it up. few players have been as dominant at the pro-level before their 18th birthday as . with a whopping 65 points in 112 games as a defenseman, has shown his game is mature enough to play against men. has all the makings of a modern-day first-pairing defenseman. an excellent skater, has a strong first pass and can keep and drive possession with his excellent instincts and puck mobility in the offensive zone. while strong offensively, he isn't a liability defensively either. he anticipates the play well defensively and has excellent gap control. rarely panics under pressure with the puck and makes excellent seam passes when being forechecked against. he also has excellent hands, making him a strong two-way threat whenever he is on the ice. some scouts have david jiricek above in this draft, but due to his proven production, i think has a slightly higher upside. he is likely a year away from nhl duty and projects as a top-pairing defender. is a mobile two-way and highly-intelligent slovak blueliner with all the makings of an elite top pairing defenseman. the standout in his game is his poise and confidence with the puck on his stick and how that is able to fuel his advanced playmaking game. he's a heads-up player at the offensive blue line, constantly surveying the offensive zone with his head on a swivel when the puck is on his stick to identify where teammates and potential offensive threats are. he's a smooth skater who is able to walk the line and use his legs to activate from the point when the puck is on his stick, allowing him to open up passing and shooting lanes with his mobility as well as making opposing checkers bite with his hands and shoulder fakes. his offensive vision is excellent, as he's capable of finding teammates with cross-ice passes to set up one-time opportunities and can feed teammates in the slot when handling the puck along the boards. he's a crisp and accurate passer who can deliver passes on the tape with purpose, as well as being capable of making soft finesse passes off both his forehand and backhand. he is also a more than capable puck-mover, as when he's working at his best his mobility, vision, and passing ability all combine to allow him to move pucks to teammates to start the breakout or move pucks himself. he's a capable defender who owns a good stick to breakup opposing rushes when defending in transition and he's generally well-positioned when defending in his own zone. in order to maximize his potential, will need to continue to work on his consistency in his reads to trim out some defensive turnovers out of his game, as well as show more growth in his strength and physicality.\n",

            " exploded onto the scene this season with a great hlinka gretzky tournament. he had good stretches in the allsvenskan, some so-so stretches that coincided with an illness and he finished off strong at the u18s. his value comes from his athleticism. he's a 6-foot-3 defenseman who is an elite skater. that combination alone is scary. there are some rushes he's made this season where the opposition didn't even have a chance to get a stick on the puck because he needs a few steps and he's blazing by guys. however, i found in league games he was hesitant to push the pace versus men like he did versus his peers. he has that ability and it may be a maturation thing. is divisive due to his offensive upside. i think there is some offense to his game. he executes give-and-goes in a clever way to make the most of his skating, he moves the puck decent on the power play, and he flashes both good handling and distributing skills. he can be careless with the puck too, and often i've seen him make terrible turnovers, but i've also seen a few high-level plays with the puck. if you're expecting more, you'll be disappointed. but if you want a two-way defenseman with size who can close a gap, man a second power play and transition the offense at even strength at a high level, he's your man. aik manager anders gozzi on : “ has enormous potential and will play in the nhl in the near future. he is one of the best defenders we have gotten in aik throughout the years due to his skating and skill level.” is a player whose post-hlinka hype surpassed the reality of his game? yes. that has always been my view. does still have a lot to offer? absolutely. when you have the length that he does and you can still skate as he can, you've got a lot to work with. the raw talent is exciting because it shows up in flashes in games when he joins the rush and carries the puck through the neutral zone. but i still have concerns about his decision-making as well as his puck handling (there are way too many bobbles at the offensive zone blueline that go the other way). he also struggles to make high-end plays with the puck once his speed has pushed him over the offensive zone blueline. in the there's no question that there's a lot to tap into. but there's definitely a lot of risk associated with taking him in the first half of the first round. one of the best pure skaters in this draft, has all of the tools to eventually become a top-four defenseman in the nhl. there have been some moderate concerns about his hockey sense and playmaking abilities, but i think those will catch up to his feet eventually. he makes pretty good reads in the offensive zone, distributes well from the defensive zone and can use his feet in transition as well as, or better than, any defenseman in this draft. has a very good, quick and accurate shot from the point, looking for open lanes and possessing the mobility to find the best option. the biggest issue i see at this point is an overreliance on his skating, to a point where it might not work at the next level like it does now. but his defending has improved over the course of the season, and his size and athleticism go a long way for him. in terms of sheer physical ability, i'd have a difficult time naming five players in this year's draft who have an edge on p . he's one of the absolute best skaters in this class, with great balance, acceleration and a blazing top-gear. when gets going, it's something to behold. the problem? might have the worst hockey sense of any of the top defensive prospects in this year's draft. his ability to sense pressure with the puck on his stick in the defensive zone is awful. in most cases, a player with decision making and hockey sense deficiencies wouldn't land in my first round. hell, they might be on my ‘do not draft' board. that said, i see the physical tools in game, and i do think that if he puts it all together, he can be a top pair defenceman in the nhl. is perhaps the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in this year's draft. some scouts have as high as a top 10 in this year's draft. while he may have the skating and size to make him a decent prospect, overall game has struggled this season. he struggled to put up points in 2nd division, and he makes questionable decisions with the puck at times. with time, may turn into a strong 2nd pairing defender. he is likely 3-4 years away from the nhl. a puck-moving defenseman with a big frame, utilizes his big body very well and once he gets some speed, he's very hard to knock off the puck. he's a great skater with strong powerful strides, especially when his agility, quickness and acceleration all come together. he makes quick side-to-side movements and is quite elusive. if he can maintain his speed, he can get past an opponent one-on-one. when he doesn't have the puck in his possession, he is still a threat offensively and likes to join the rush to create odd-man advantages. he's very mobile on the offensive blue line and he's constantly moving and trying to find open ice. overall, he's a very good passer and can make smart plays to set up his teammates in the offensive zone. able to fire wrist shots through traffic, but he seems to lack shot strength and accuracy. defensively, he plays a simple but active game. he makes good reads and intercepts passes in the neutral zone. he also has an active stick with good reach while playing in his own zone. he uses his big frame well and is a tough opponent to win a board battle against. on the downside, he sometimes seems to be too one-sided and opponents quickly learn his patterns. he needs to learn when to carry the puck himself and when to use his teammates.\n",

            " was leaned on as the top defenseman for the he ended the season on a high note at the u18 five nations in february co-leading the tournament in scoring. he's a great skating defenseman in all directions with size that allows him to make a ton of stops. his gap control is excellent, and he killed so many rushes with how well he closed on opponents. he's also a physical player who shows no hesitancy to close on checks with his body. top speed is very good, not elite, but he can lead rushes well and isn't afraid to jump into the play. his edges are excellent, allowing him to spin off pressure, to pivot and walk the offensive blue line very well. he was the pp1 guy for but the main question on him is his offensive upside. he has skill and can make a very good first pass, but i wouldn't call him a dynamic playmaker. his production may not wow you, but he had a strong campaign points-wise relative to other top defensemen at his age historically, especially since he didn't has a u18 world championship to compete in and he's a very young 2002 birth date. there are things about game and season that can't be disputed. he was excellent in the second half, which is likely linked to his summer birthday and the added runway he had (and has) to continue to develop as a result. he's an excellent skater. i used to think his skating was just very good but it's better than that, particularly in straight lines (though also laterally). he's a mature, polished defender for his age, not only in the way he defends the rush but also off the cycle with the decisions he makes on reads and pressure. i would, however, dispute his offensive upside. some scouts believe to be the clear no. 2 defenceman in this draft. many of those same scouts believe he has the potential to be a first pairing defenceman. that's where i disagree, or at least where i have my doubts. will be able to run a power play as he progresses up levels as he has with the ntdp? probably. but i don't think he's so dynamic that he's going to be a game-breaking offensive threat or a pp1 guy. there's no question he can open up his feet and create lanes for himself across the offensive zone blue line: and there's no question he can lead the rush and pull away in transition: but i don't see the small area skill that most top-pairing defencemen now have: projects more as a well-rounded second-pairing defender for me and i will track his collegiate career closely to see if he can change my mind. with senators prospect jonny tychonick leaving north dakota for omaha next fall and captain colton poolman graduating, will likely be asked to do a lot behind jacob-bernard docker and matt kiersted as a freshman with the fighting hawks next season. no matter what zone is in, he owns the ice. he is a robust two-way defenseman, who can apply tight gap control in his own zone and is elusive in the offensive zone. in the defensive zone, is tough to beat. if you are skating up the ice with the puck, will track you, give you little room and will utilize his stick to steal the puck away from you. there are only two things that i would like to see improve in defensive game is his slot defense. at times, positioning in the slot will be off and will let his attackers slip by him. if can strength his slot defense and apply the same pressure that he applies on the and side of the ice, he will be tough to beat. the second thing that i would like to see improved is decision-making when he is possessing the puck on the boards in his own zone. when you look at transitional play, you immediately fall head over heels. the whitefish, montana native is highly productive at getting the puck from his zone to the offensive zone. if does carry the puck from zone to zone, he will make use of his strong crossovers, edges and pivots to work his way through the neutral zone and into the offensive zone. not only will control the cycle and be defensively responsible in the offensive zone, he also possesses a strong wrist shot and will complete accurate centered pass/tape to tape passes to help key up scoring chances. an incredible skater and pure two-way defender, has risen up the charts this season and made an especially powerful impression by leading the u18 five nations tournament in scoring. offensive skills are not necessarily the strongest points of his game, but he has a great understanding of how to make plays when they're available to him. he's not going to force it just to force it. and defensively, is one of the more gifted blueliners in this class with good physical strength and a propensity to initiate contact. the son of former nhl forward geoff , has an excellent feel for the game and doesn't get caught out of position often. he plays like a pro and is headed to the university of north dakota, where his game should flourish. we've seen the light. many of the scouts and executives we spoke with upon publishing our last draft board told us that was a top ten prospect. it seemed a little rich at the time, but we reviewed the tape, ran the data, and came to see things their way. might not have the offensive dynamism of a drysdale-type, but he does everything really damn well. there's a theory in some scouting circles that the is a criminally under-covered league, and u18 defenceman might be a skating example of just that. the games stopped, and stock kept on soaring. it's amazing what added exposure can do for a player's stock when everyone has the time to check the film. we just might be guilty as sin on this charge, too. creeped towards the top-ten before the hockey world paused, but it's the time we've spent investigating his game since that has vaulted him firmly into the mix. when i say firmly in the mix; i mean firmly in the mix. there really isn't much room between and our top-rated defenceman jamie drysdale of the erie otters, our no. 5 ranked skater in the upcoming draft. stylistically, of course, they are world's apart. we love to bet on upside, and drysdale's offensive defensive stylings lend itself to just that. , on the other hand, is the rare jack of all trades, somehow also a master of all trades player. he doesn't play with a level of offensive dynamism that we've come to expect of defenceman with this sort of price tag, but he does everything at an above-average to high-end level across the board. it all starts in the feet for . he's an elite skater, layering nimble ankle flexion through a 90-degree knee bend, with fluidity through his hips. his boot placement allows for the maximum generation of power through the entirety of the blade, with his feet underneath his knees as the mark of a wel i-placed stride recovery. the force multiplier on skating is the authority and decisiveness with which he plays. there's no hesitation on part when closing on an opponent, angling into a board battle, or sprinting into a pocket of space. if the player i've thus far described sounds like an ace in transition, that's with good reason. dir. of north scouting had this to say in a june meeting: \" is the best transitional defenceman i've come across in four-plus years of collecting this data.\" does an excellent job of mitigating risk with his footwork, timing his c-cuts well, and guiding the puck-carrier calmly to within his reach, at which point he drives the shoulder through his opponent and eliminates possession. if finds himself in a position to collect the puck; he immediately turns place up-ice, whether it's with a wel i-placed stretch pass or by carrying it himself through traffic. he's not afraid to use the middle of the ice, and he's surprisingly nimble in transition for someone who isn't especially skilled, handling the puck ably on the forehand, the backhand, and integrating slip and hook passes in sticky situations. where one arrives at skepticism with game is what happens when the puck is in the offensive zone. he's doubtless shown significant this season as a creative distributor, and he started to flash some serious puck skills before the stoppage in play. it's just that he started from a fairly limited spot; even drastic improvement doesn't put him in the upper echelon of offensive defencemen in this year's draft. mostly, creates through rush activation and as a trailing option on developing rush plays. here's what our scout had to say about offensive skill set in a player report on the north dakota committed defenceman. \"without the puck, recognizes appropriate times to join the rush and pinches on opposing wingers well, sealing off pass options along the boards and, in turn, preventing breakouts. he's got a quick wrister as well that can create havoc\" there are no such questions about ability to defend. on the puck, off the puck -- he's full value, likely the best in-zone defender in the entire class. he's calculated, disciplined, physical, and creative. there just isn't much that he can't do in the defensive zone at an exceptionally high level. then there are, of course, the intangible qualities. talk to anyone who's had the chance to interview , on the media or the team side, and they'll all rave about his quality as a leader and a stand-up kid. we value upside first and foremost at eliteprospects, and has everything it takes to develop into a no. 2 or 3 defenceman with value in all three phases of special teams at the next level. it doesn't sound sexy, especially for a player in this range, but it's a result most teams wi 11 take any day of the week around tenth overal i. the son of long-time nhler geoff, skates like his father. has a long stride and uses it to gain ground on attacking forwards quickly. he is also very physical and uses his frame well to rub out opposing forwards. he isn't afraid to step up in the neutral zone and throw a big hit either. does everything well, but it's his upside that has him approaching the second half of the first round for me. while his speed is uncanny and he looks like a solid two-way defender, he is unlikely to ever be a big point producer, though after some further observation i believe the tools are there. he looks like a sure thing as a second-pairing defender who can play in all situations, meaning he will likely be coveted and could even enter the top 10. a highly mobile defenseman, is incredibly athletic and has an incredible toolbox. using his smooth skating to be a dynamic puck-moving defender, his hands and decision-making have steadily caught up with his feet. he's incredibly elusive with the puck, able to turn on the jets and cut through traffic with ease. gets up to speed in a hurry, both forward and backward, with long, smooth strides. likes to take matters into his own hands and carry the puck for zone exits and entries. defensive work is average, as he keeps a good gap and can recover into position quickly, but he lacks size and strength, and doesn't seem to see the ice quite as well without the puck as when he has it. turns over the puck at times, but that's to be expected for a guy who has it on his stick as much as he does. offensively, he exudes a lot of confidence and clearly wants to make a positive difference for his team. however, his decision-making is an issue, as his puck rushes often end up going into dangerous areas before the puck ends up getting turned over and going the other direction. he uses his skating to get his shot through opposing defenders, though his shot itself and his passing are good but not elite. he mostly makes simple plays on the man-advantage because he doesn't have enough creativity. overall, he is a defender that has the potential to combine mobility, strength, physical play and speed with a high-level vision and hockey iq.\n",

            " had a tough season, missing time due to injury and contracting mononucleosis late in the season. when healthy, though, he was awesome and a dominant at the level. he's a well-rounded prospect without any clear weakness in his game and a lot of high-end elements. he's a great skater with a clean stride and can barrel down the wing with speed. speed is good, not overwhelming, but he's got a fantastic first step and a great overall pace to his game. he combines that pace with very good hands and vision, showing how versatile a threat he can be. he can make creative plays off the flank and sees his options well. it's not just his speed and skill that stand out, but his compete level is elite. is the kind of forward who can dangle around defensemen, blow by them or drive his way through them. he gets to the net, consistently and without fear. he battles for pucks as hard as anyone and typically wins them, even at 5-foot-11. he's not the biggest but that is really the only criticism i can find of his game. has been a top prospect for many years and this season he showed exactly why he's been so touted. u18 coach john wroblewski on : “sandpaper and silk. he's the perfect blend of speed, skill and power. he's kind of a brad marchand type who plays he's got that 1-on-1 ability, he's got a great shot in tight, unbelievable vision and he plays with an edge. his game is predicated on him driving the puck to the net and putting the opposition on their heels. his bravery combined with his speed makes him the player that he is.” when missed much of the first half of the season due to injury, i expected it would take him some time to adjust and find his game after he returned, especially given the way hughes and trevor zegras were playing down the middle for the that wasn't the case … at all. was, from the moment he returned to game action, the biggest driving force behind hughes. there were a number of games when zegras, cole caufield, matthew boldy or cam york would grab the attention. there were plenty of them, frankly. but was the most consistent of the bunch. he doesn't have the finishing ability of caufield or the cross-ice playmaking ability of zegras, but he's a significantly better two-way player than both while remaining an exciting offensive threat as a passer and a shooter. is strong on the puck, powerful when he chooses and careful when he needs to be. add that to the way he fights to win pucks back and keep plays alive and you've got arguably the most complete player in the draft. it has been a winding season for , who was on the shelf with a significant injury the first half of the season and had to deal with a bout of mono toward the end, but when he was healthy, he was exceptional. he is a smart, two-way forward with an unrelenting motor and an ability to make plays in the offensive end of the ice. is dogged in puck pursuit and remarkably strong, despite being average-sized. he is a fierce competitor but does not step over the line very often. he is not always flashy and doesn't always make the eye-popping play, but he makes the plays. goes hard to the net and into the corners, and he has the touch and plus-level vision to make plays under duress and find better options in tougher situations with the puck on his stick. on top of that, has good speed and can make plays in transition. he has deceptive feet, showcasing a good second gear that allows him to beat defenders wide or challenge them inside. although his season was abbreviated by injury, some of his rate stats stand out. he appeared in just 16 games against competition but had 34 points, an average of 2.13 points per game -- higher than hughes. his 1.68 points per game in all competitions for the u18 team was second only to hughes, albeit a distant second. had remained healthy for the entirety of his draft-season, it's entirely possible he'd be a legitimate candidate as a top-five selection across the board. produced at over a two points per game pace against competition with the this season and almost matched those numbers playing against the ncaa.only phil kessel, auston matthews, and jack hughes have matched or bettered that pace over a prolonged sample in the history. , committed to the university of for 2019-20, put these numbers up playing mostly on the second line, behind hughes. as impressive as raw production is, it's even better when contextualized looking at his time-on-ice. when was on the ice at 5-on-5, he produced roughly four points per hour — the best rate from any player, in any league, in this class — and his seal adjusted scoring rate of 1.76 points per game is second only to kakko. there isn't a catch, either. it's not like is giving up a lot defensively. this is a player that's every bit as proficient from his own zone as he is the offensive zone. one scout that i spoke with compared him to patrice bergeron, after qualifying that he hates player comparisons. the speed, skill, production — it's all there. can be a dynamic, franchise centre at the next level if he stays healthy. there isn't any one component of centre game that isn't high-end or elite — i don't throw the latter of those two words around lightly, either, you'll find. he's a highly competitive, two-way centre with elite vision and playmaking ability; a player that has the potential to develop into a patrice bergeron-like player at the nhl level. the only question i have about is whether he'll be able to stay healthy enough to put all those tools together and carve out a highly-successful, long-term nhl career. time has proven that injuries, particularly when a player is this young, are more about luck than anything else, and i'm clearly not deterred as his ranking can attest. has committed to the university of next season, where he'll have every opportunity to play significant minutes, in high-leverage situations, and both phases of special teams. it's the perfect spot for his unfortunately for the badgers, it's going to be more of a pit stop than anything else. game is mature beyond his years, and he'll be able to transition to the nhl in not much time at all. , overall this season, averaged over 2 points per game. this, in fact, was a higher rate than #1 prospect jack hughes. if it wasn't for injury, would have set numerous records this season. has very few flaws in his game if any. he boasts excellent offensive ability and plays a well rounded game. he hates losing and plays with a tenacious flare and high compete level, a level that is considered one of the highest in the draft overall. is likely a year away from nhl duty, but it wouldn't be surprisingly to see him in the nhl late next season. projects as a two-way #1 at the nhl level. a skilled two-way forward, has an amazing top speed that allows him to create many controlled zone entries. he owns great acceleration and agility, which makes him deadly on the breakout and in the neutral zone. though it looks like he's still getting used to his legs, his skating is effective and powerful allowing him to break through contact and drive to the net or down low. with both great speed and puck protection, he passes defensemen on the outside with ease at high speed. he pushes the pace of play and carries the puck through the neutral zone and into the offensive end at full speed. he's big and lanky with a good amount of power that enables him to be a dominant force with the puck. an exciting player to watch, he boasts nice hands and can beat opponents one-on-one with creative stick work. he has the ability to spread the ice and draw defenders over to him, while then firing cross-ice passes to set up teammates for scoring chances. not afraid to be a net-front presence, he shows he's willing to do anything to score and win. he has some filthy mitts and he can pull off incredible moves to create space for himself. he's very competitive and he will battle with intensity for every loose puck. he backchecks with intensity and is very involved defensively.\n",

            " , the younger brother of detroit's first-round pick evgeni , has been highly touted for many years in this draft class and tore up the this past season. he's an offensive dynamo on the wing, showing an ability to create scoring chances in many ways with one nhl scout coining him a “five-tool prospect” — a term borrowed from baseball to describe that he's very good at everything with no glaring weakness. he's a good skater and very quick for a player with a pro frame. he often surprises opposing players with how quickly he can close on them due to his speed and reach, forcing a ton of turnovers. he's a very powerful player due to his speed and size, he gets to the net as well as anyone in the draft and can be a handful for defenders to deal with when he's barreling down the wing. when he's not bulldozing his way through defenders, he can make high skilled plays off the rush and is a very creative playmaker. he's one of the better passers in this draft class who can make tough dishes with consistency and looks for his teammates. has also been one of the more dangerous goal scorers in major junior and can finish chances from afar. he's been a solid penalty killer in barrie and a shorthanded threat. there has been a serious debate in some scouting circles about who the second-best player in the 2018 class is. as good as filip zadina is, i don't subscribe to that belief. not only can score in more ways than any other player in this draft, but he also plays one of, if not the most powerful game of the bunch. the mastery of game is that he doesn't beat teams by breaking down players one-on-one. instead, he thrives off of the puck, makes plays quickly when he does have it and just plainly gets open. and when he gets the puck with time or space, he can score with his feet, his hands, and most of all his shot. wrister low blocker, backhand shelf, one-timer high glove from distance, snapshot five hole. it doesn't matter. he'll pick his spot and he'll score. he's also a threat attacking off the wall and the rush because he's so adept at handling the puck out wide and making plays at full speed. he was the best pure scorer in the as a rookie, and did the same in the a year earlier. had he played aaron luchuk's 68 games, 62-goal pace would have been 12 more than any other play in the he should step in and be a contributing top-six forward in the nhl next year. an elite goal scorer and powerful skater, has a chance to jump into the nhl and contribute. with 40 goals in just 44 games with barrie this season, 0.91 goals per game is not terribly far off from the pace of mcdavid (0.94) and steven stamkos (0.95) in their draft-eligible seasons in the in fact, looking at the past decade of u-18 goal-scoring rates in the had one of the best seasons over that span. can score his goals a variety of ways. he has the power and strength to get to the front of the net, as well as the elite shot to beat goalies from any distance. he's also exceptional when it comes to shooting off the pass. much of his success offensively comes from his legs, with an ability to beat defenders wide, exploit teams in transition and drive to the net. one potential point of concern is what will happen when power game is no longer the decisive advantage that it is at the junior level. that said, he has high-level instincts in the offensive zone, and his hand skills are above average. he always seems to find himself in good positions, but he can make quick decisions under pressure and find a way to get his shot off. additionally, he's adequate away from the puck, can get engaged physically and has a solid work ethic on the ice. most years, he's an easy no. 1 overall pick, but there just so happens to be a freak of nature born the same year. physically ready for the nhl, blends world-class finishing ability with hard-nosed and defensively responsible play. a goal scorer who can impact the game in all situations. a terrific blend of speed, power, and precision. he'll be a front-line threat for years to come. a dynamic multi-tool threat, he has the wheels and the demeanour to dictate pace on the ice. an excellent skater who can turn on a dime, who can cut in and out of traffic. deceptive edgework, too. he owns a powerful. nhl-calibre shot with a deadly release. but he can also pick apart the opposition with his elite passing game. with a tremendous touch and world-class stickhandling, he is able to undress hapless defenders. not afraid to lower his shoulder and muscle his way to the net. on top of which, he has good defensive instincts and abilities, which he uses to counter-attack with vigour. one-on-one, he's a nifty as you would expect. lots of strength, but a light touch with the puck. even under heavy pressure, he stays under control in possession. creative to the point that he's been known to try to score lacrosse-style goals. some scouts, however, expect him to be even more dominant. others would like to see him use his teammates more frequently. his physical game is a work in progress, but he can punish unsuspecting opponents. he also has a knack for getting under their skin. defensively, he can competently add to coverage. aggressive in his own zone and eager stymie the opposition. he's a full-package scoring winger and, quite possibly, ready to step into the nhl as quickly as next season.\n",

            " is one of the biggest mysteries i can recall of the last few years watching prospects. he was a go-to player for coming up, as the no. 1 for a solid u18 age group last season and making u20 team a year before his draft, while also playing well versus men. he looked like a high-skill playmaking with good athletic tools. then this season came and the offense disappeared. game looked so simple between the junior and levels and he was cut from the u20 team. various scouts have varying theories. some think he lacks speed. some think he lacks hockey sense. i've seen enough over the years to still believe in the player, but it's fair to say i approach him with a large degree of caution. he has skill in his game. he has quick-twitch hands and is great at handling the puck in small areas. he's a fine, albeit awkward, skater who makes skilled plays on the move but needs to add more pace to his game. his playmaking and shot are both solid quality, but neither are spectacular. he has some physicality to his game and brings energy to shifts. that's the i think is there, and may show up in future years, but he didn't this season. in a sentence, projects as an nhl second-line after being one of my top-ranked prospects coming into the draft season. there's a lot to unpack in terms of the how and why of rollercoaster progression to this point (which i delve into in the story hyperlinked below). a lot of his tools are assets that should serve him well within the north game if/when he comes over, which helps with some of the challenges of projecting him forward today. he's got a pro frame, quick hands, and a hard wrist shot (though he does tend to rattle a few too many of them off of the boards). his skating continues to be a focus for him as he works to build a little more agility into his power, which is already decent. when he's engaged and active, he can be an effective forechecker who wins back possession and then makes plays off of the wall to the interior. when he's playing with confidence with the puck, he's also got the tools needed to create high-danger attempts for himself. i do worry about his decision-making, though, and there will continue to be ceiling and floor questions if his trajectory doesn't begin to follow a steeper incline sooner rather than later. the parts are there, though, and i expect a big showing at next year's world juniors could help him rebuild some of the confidence he's lost. when he's on his game, he's still fun to watch. is a menace in the offensive zone. he controls the cycle quite well. if there is a decent amount of traffic in front of , he will opt to make tight turns/pivots to fool his opponents and give himself some more space. when is completing a turn, you can expect his turn radius to be pretty tight. this allows him to dance around his opponent without error. aside from his crossovers, when you watch game tape closely, you will see that he has a bit of a heavy foot. due to his heavy foot, speed and edges are not always sound. previously held in higher regard as a prospect, hasn't had the best time of it these past few months. excluded from squad for the iihf world junior championship, he collected only six points in 35 games for karpat. at his best, is a dynamic presence on the ice, with a strong, heavy shot, and exceptional stickhandling skills. but while he needs to learn to use his size and strength to greater advantage, the bigger issue might lie with whether he can get his head together after such a disappointing stretch. still, the 18-year-old forward boasts so much potential. entered the year as the prohibitive favourite for the no. 1 overall spot, and what a fall from grace it's been for the pivot since. the world juniors would've been a nice opportunity for to correct course, but the coaching staff had other plans. the good news? really come on in recent weeks playing against men in the a slick puckhandler, and he couples that with crossover-heavy rush patterns to throw opposing defenders in a blender. his skating needs a fair bit of work. the output is greater than the inputs suggest it should be, but there's no getting around his flared knees and a lack of ankle flexion. was the prohibitive favourite for the no. 1 overall spot in the 2021 nhl entry draft this time last year. there wasn't even any debate about it two seasons ago; it was , and then everyone else. it's been all downhill since, and now it wouldn't come as any surprise to our staff to see fall from the ﬁrst round period. the thing is, just hasn't played all that well. he will have earned every draft spot that goes by before he eventually hears his name called. you could've guessed that much looking at his elite prospects page. scored only six points in 35 games with karpat, a drastic fall in points per game output from the four points he amassed in 12 contests just a year prior. jeremy davis' pgps (prospect graduation probabilities system) captures that statistical stagnation aptly. three-year regressed pgps xls% (expected likelihood of success) is 26 percent, but his work in the this season only carries a 12 percent mark. that three-year regressed xls% is among the higher outputs in the group, but his draft-year mark is more ﬁtting of a mid-round pick than a top-10 talent. there's still hope for , and much of it traces back to his shot. he generates so much power on every release by sacriﬁcing a quick drawback, instead taking his sweet time loading downforce into his lever-action wrister. it's a hard, accurate shot when he has the time and space to send it on net. it's not enough to just have an nhl calibre shot, though. the best goal-scorers know how to increase the odds by taking the puck to the sensitive spots in the offensive zone, whether it's driving the centre lane as a puck-carrier or hounding the net-front for loose pucks. there's no need to tell that twice. he'll drive the centre lane with the puck on nearly every entry, and he isn't shy about setting up shop at the net-front even if it means paying a physical toll on every shift. he's physical, able to play off of contact and absorb shock, and those qualities serve him well just outside of the blue paint. the same is true of his off-the-puck timing; every goal-scorer needs that killer instinct to consistently produce at the nhl level. the problem is that is a little bit too focused on playing the net-front and driving the centre lane than is perhaps necessary. he always wants to take on opposing defencemen in space -- he suffers from a nasty bit of tunnel vision -- and tends to do so from a glide. he's a crafty handler, but this approach isn't sustainable. “there were sequences that me wondering about adaptability and problem-solving,” elite prospects dir. of european scouting lassi alanen remarked in a september game report. “he tried to brute-force his way through the middle a couple of times and simply didn't have the speed to do so when he instead could have gone for a drop pass play or tried to get his linemates involved in other ways.” certainly, propensity to engage opposing defenders in space isn't projectable with his handling base and skating form. he keeps the puck in front of him as a carrier, exposing it to unnecessary risk in space. and he's a heavy skater, with a wide recovery and a lack of ankle ﬂexion in his forward stride. in a year where so much of game either plateaued or took a nosedive, we have to spare a little print for his growth as a defensive contributor. his work rate took a turn for the better, and he was a hound for loose puck retrievals. his defensive reads got better, too. the sum of all these parts leaves you with a pretty interesting player. is a north-south, shoot-ﬁrst winger with a shot that barely registers as above-average and poor skating form. the contradictions in his game are obvious, but so too is the talent that once made him a candidate for the top spot in this year's draft. recalibrate your expectations, and is still an interesting player from about the middle of the ﬁrst round onward. he could credibly hang in an nhl middle-six at the height of his career, but it's far from a certainty. he needs to bounce back in a big way next season. heading into the season, was the consensus number one pick in this draft. he made the world junior championship as a 16-year-old and didn't look out of place. he looked like a sure-fire, play-driving top-six forward. however, his game took a massive dip this past season. failed to make world junior team and struggled offensively all season long. however, even with a difficult season, there are some strong pieces and tools here. has elite skating ability and hands. in the past and in moments this season, he has shown that he may be able to drive play at the nhl level. when at his best, he is tenacious in the offensive zone and picks up speed with the puck on his stick. he isn't afraid to attack the net and dive into high danger scoring areas to create opportunities. biggest question mark is his ceiling. before this season, it looked like he could be a first-line with a high offensive ceiling. now this has come into question. with only six points in this season, may be more of support offensively in the nhl and a middle-six forward instead of a top-six. consistency was an issue last season, and he struggled with the transition from junior league to its top league. that being said, has the tools to be a top-six forward at the nhl level. his next season will be huge and will give us a better gauge of his overall ceiling. he is likely two to three years away from nhl duty. is one of the more interesting prospects in this class. his vision is excellent, finding the lanes very well and processing how the game is evolving around him and reacting. he's a premier playmaker with a big bag of tricks. he can pass effortlessly on his backhand, including no-look and behind his back. his puck control is very good, with hands that are deceptive and fast. he can maneuver the puck through small gaps in sticks and skates, which helps him a lot in 50-50 puck battles. he displays good effort offensively, pushing the pace, forcing turnovers and making a consistent effort to leave his mark. he's not particularly big, but there are some power elements to his game. he's hard to slow down when he gets the puck with a head of steam. he knows how to cut players off, with or without the puck, cutting through player's hands to create space, and protect the puck. his shot can be a weapon at times, but he can revert to a sweeping shot from the perimeter often as well. after gaining the zone at times, he can tend to lose his dynamic posture, resorting to the “a” stance and losing his mobility. battles very hard for the puck in the corners and along the boards. on one occasion, he wasn't giving his all when defending the rush, coasting on the way back and skating by the open man in front of the net, who shortly after scored, undefended. what really holds him back is his hockey sense. he's a very single-track-minded player, as he'll pick something that he wants to try and then get blinders on about doing it, failing to adjust if necessary or to spot better options. he often tries to force the play he wants, and that makes him easier to defend. without the puck he doesn't do enough checking over his shoulder or keeping his head on a swivel, which causes him to lose his defensive coverage or skate away from the action at others. his skating mechanics are a little choppy as well, almost like he's stomping around the ice at times. has a bit of trouble turning and changing direction. his movement just isn't smooth overall, forcing him to rely on his leg power and balance instead.\n",

            " played most of the year at shattuck's u18 team — for a third season — but did get some time with fargo in the to end 2020-21. it's been tough to get a read on him due to the caliber of opponent he's played, but he has a clear nhl toolkit. he's 6-foot-2, highly skilled, and can skate with nhl players. his skating has progressed over time into a strength, showing the ability to lead an attack and walk the line. he is very confident with the puck and attacks with his skill. he can make plays, but he overcomplicates the game and makes some questionable decisions. defensively he's just ok. he can be a bit soft on his checks and lack physicality. in a sentence, has some nhl qualities that give him a chance, but has to add elements to his game to allow him to play. this season, dominated the prep school circuit more than just about any player i've watched and tracked in recent years. he's an excellent transition defender who transports pucks confidently, plays boldly inside the offensive zone, and possesses impressive handling skill for a defenceman. at shattuck, he was an exit/entry machine who carved teams up through the neutral zone with head fakes, side-steps and cuts (his skating really impresses on its edges, even if he's not explosive). when he's on the ice, he wants to take over and direct play in possession and does so by guiding opposing players out of his way. i didn't think he looked quite like himself in his six games with the fargo force but he was jumping into a new team (which already had three established top defenders) and a new league during the playoffs. with some fine-tuning defensively, where he can be a little wayward at times (though some of that has to do with some bad habits creeping in at a level that was beneath him, i think), there's serious upside to game. when it comes to his playing style, he can be handful to skate around. when moves from the offensive zone to the neutral zone, he tends to play close to the vest and will opt to utilize his stick to push attackers away from his blue-line. once he gets across his blue-line, he lowers his body and widens his stance. by doing so, he eliminates lanes for attackers. the attackers end up along the half-wall. with that being said, the goal to prevent high danger scoring chances and does that with his preventive defense specialties. when is patrolling the boards in his zone, he alters his gap control. sometimes, will be in your face and apply a quality backcheck. he tends to tighten up more so around the red line. doesn't just stick to his own side. he owns the ice. at a moments notice, he will deviate and switch to the side if he feels that his defensive partner is struggling at neutralizing the attack. with his defensive style, you can expect to be the last defenseman to re-enter the defensive zone and that is due to his aggressive defensive measures in the neutral zone. thrives in the neutral zone and it would be a mistake to force him to adjust his style. instead, coaches should expect to pair him with a defenseman who drops back to the net consistently. from a puck movement perspective, there is a lot to cover with . his puck movement is quite similar to barrie colts defenseman brandt clarke. uses well-timed crossovers in the defensive zone to help drive his acceleration. he will not drive the play through dangerous situations. if there is an attacker bearing down on him, he adjusts on the fly, drops back and tries a different lane. but, he doesn't just drop back in the neutral and defensive zones, he also plays it safe in the offensive zone when traffic is in front of him. when controlling the puck in the neutral zone, like clarke, he will zig-zag around to avoid confrontations with his opponents. while he is effective at controlled transitions, there are instances in uncontrolled transitions where runs into some problems. sometimes decision-making on his first pass is off the mark and his passes lead to turnovers in front of his net. in addition, when he is finding the teammate to pass the puck to and shifting around traffic in his own zone, there are instances where struggles to keep the puck on his stick and that leads to cough ups without much contact from opponents. skating is quite strong. his foot extension is long, which allows him to take fewer strides when in transition. the recovery is not too wide, which is critical for strong mobility. his edges and crossovers are the main drivers for his acceleration and come in handy when navigating/stick-handling in the offensive zone. in the offensive zone, loves to pinch, skate up the boards and complete centered passes to the slot. while you would expect mostly to pinch and control the cycle on the side of the ice, that is not always the case. as mentioned above, likes to command the game and will alternate between rushing up the and side. additionally, you can expect to charge through the slot and will use his stick-handling skills to swerve around attackers. all-in-all, his offensive play is quite strong, but i would like to see some refinement on his shot. when is shooting from the blue-line, his shot goes wide quite a bit. but, any time that you are taking a long-range shot, you need to expect that the chances of the puck reaching the net and not bouncing off the boards are much lower than if you are shooting from the slot or at doorstep. there's no way around it: one of the trickiest projections in the draft class. he was beyond the prep circuit last year, yet returned for another season. while he often flipped the switch and dominated, just like he should, major questions went unanswered. “ offensive game is built on exerting sustained pressure, comprising manipulation, activation, and the use of his plus four-way mobility to exploit poorly gapped defenders and over-zealous forecheckers,” elite prospects high school regional scout daniel gee wrote in a mid-season profile. with constant hip pocket deception, changes of pace, and eyes that never reveal the intended play, he embarrasses defenders. after breaking down a defender, he continues the manipulation to drag over another defender, before rolling his wrists, turning the fake shot into a pass to an open teammate. even with flawed, power-limiting shooting mechanics, not shy about stepping in and firing. in transition, uses that same manipulation ability to great effect. for him, the manipulation starts on the retrieval, where he misdirects opponents. in open ice, those fake shots become fake passes, looking in an open direction just long enough to bait the forechecker in one direction before going the other. projectability concerns start with skating, which lacks ankle flexion, hip engagement, and power. acceleration isn't any better, as he tends to keep his weight on his heels, and his low pace of operation only amplifies the skating concerns. sometimes, a physical, aggressive defender with some play-killing ability. mostly, he's low-energy and reactive, as elite prospects lead scout st-louis describes: “failed to take the extra stride to cut a play that led to a high-danger chance at least twice.” rush defence often highlights a lack of translatability to higher levels, as gee explains, “he won't be able to overpower opponents with his aggressiveness and he will have to learn to better guide rushing attacks better.” according to david st-louis, there are some questions about the scalability of the offence he creates: “the general formulaic aspect of his offensive game (the same moves every time). is he really manipulating or has he learned tricks so well that they work anyway even if the timing isn't exactly right?” a late-season stint with fargo helped answer that question in part, with his moves being largely the same but his timing and pace adapting to the better competition. could become a flashy, puck-moving second-pairing defenceman, even his critics see that upside. but the uncertainty of his projection keeps him just outside the top-50. he heads to umass next season. offensive-minded blue-liner excelled at prep school. will be an excellent challenge and determine ceiling next season. is a highly-skilled defender who can be a difference-maker on offence with his high-end skating and puck skills. his footwork is exceptional. he might be one of the best skaters in the class, at least amongst defensemen. it all stems from his posture, strong ankle flex, good knee bend, lets his shoulders roll, but keeps his chest and head up. he can explode in all four directions. he also utilizes crossovers very often, constantly changing direction up the ice as he leads breakouts and entries. if he doesn't use his feet, he can look up the ice and spot his teammates through traffic, often shooting long bombs from his zone to the opponent's blue line to spring his man. his puckhandling is also high-end, as he has the ability to skate into and out of traffic, often coming out with the puck. this combination makes a very promising offensive player. also brings a calmness to his game, drawing attackers in before making a play. he can combine all of these aspects at times, although this also transitions into the less-than-positive traits. however, when he gets too focused on getting through or past traffic, he puts blinders on and gets too focused on himself. he doesn't notice the wide-open teammates he has and then ends up not using his teammates and runs out of space, leading to a turnover. where really shows cause for concern is in his defensive game. there's a lack of both urgency and awareness in his own end, resulting in missed assignments, missed pucks, and numerous turnovers. much of this can be associated to a lack of scanning the zone. he tends to get too focused on the puck or what is in front of him and loses where his opponents are. he can also make some poor decisions, such as trying to force a pass through traffic in front of his own net. when defending the rush, he also tends to skate at his attackers. while this may work for him now, it's not something that will translate. he needs to learn to angle out, taking away the attackers space and forcing them to the boards rather than skating at them. he also maintains his gap and speed when skating backwards through crossovers rather than cuts, which will see him exploited at the next level.\n",

            " was a solid piece for hv71 and world junior team this season. all he has done is produce wherever he's gone the past few seasons. he won't dazzle with high-end dekes, but there is a lot of skill to game. he makes quick decisions, has a quick shot, sees his options well and has good puck skills. he can be a standout offensive player, though that isn't always the case. might be below average in size, but he's tough and strong for a player his age, and he can kill penalties adequately. i don't love his skating, but he isn't dragging anvils all over the ice, and considering all the other positive attributes in his offensive game, you can live without game-breaking speed. played in the top league for majority of the last two campaigns and looked strong. doesn't excel in any particular skill, but has a well-stocked tool belt. a very safe player. is a strong, intelligent, and mature twoway who gives a strong effort in all situations and demonstrates tenacity; constantly finding ways to impact the game. he is a fine skater with good power, using long strides to get up to top speed quickly. he doesn't show breakaway speed, but has enough speed to stay ahead of the play. despite his sub six-foot size, he's very good along the wall and knows how to leverage his low of gravity to get underneath larger opponents and protect the puck with his body. he's adept at cycling the puck in the offensive zone, showing good lower-body strength and the instincts to peel off the boards and get to the front of the net when given an open lane. he is also dangerous when given time in the offensive zone, as he possesses good vision and the ability to shoot with good power while off-balance. although creative, he plays a relatively simple, smart and efficient game. he has an accurate shot with velocity, fooling goaltenders with its quick release and placement. he is dominant on face-offs. he leans offense, but backchecks hard and keeps his head on a swivel to cover the trailing man on the rush. is very defensively aware and shows a consistent effort in skating hard on the back check to support his defenders, making plays on the puck carrier. he can play both and wing but is a natural as he does a good job coming down deep to support and being part of the breakout. when playing wing he does a good job covering his point man and pressuring the puck along the wall to try and create a turnover. he shows good two-way awareness, has a mature approach to defense and some strong offensive abilities making him a well-rounded prospect. we hear a lot of chatter about being a rough skater” with feet that “will holdhi back at the next level but we do not share these scouting opinions. although his explosiveness and consistency could use some improvement, he like his developing mobility. he is a prospect with a solid overall two-way game but is not likely going to become a high-end offensive catalyst in the nhl. we see him as a very good second line in a henrik zetterberg-type, twoway role but there are plenty out there who see him as a bottom-six, third or fourth line, forward at best in the nhl. will that effect his draft status, as teams tend to go for those prospects who can fill the net and influence the scoreboard? we like him plenty and think he can affect the score of the game substantially, which is why we ranked him so highly.\n",

            " impressed at the junior level before their season was canceled. his pro and u18 worlds had good flashes but not consistency. has very good stick skills, is able to deke through checks frequently and create a lot of chances with his skill. he can create off the perimeter with his playmaking, finding seams and making creative passes, but his shot is more dangerous as a legit mid-range weapon to pick corners. works off the puck and creates turnovers with his effort. his main flaw for the nhl is the lack of nhl speed and ability to pull away from opponents. in a sentence, projects as a bottom-six nhl winger. is a play-driving, versatile winger with a standout wrist shot, who pushes tempo through neutral ice with a compact stride. he makes a lot of smart, aggressive plays inside the offensive zone, and can process the game at speed. when he gets the puck, he's looking to take it at defenders and attack the inside. but there's also variety to his game and when the play to the middle isn't there, he has demonstrated a knack for being unpredictable, so there is a creative flair to his game. recent viewings (both before and into u18s) did leave me feeling like he was missing the defining skill needed to turn a b-plus prospect you take in the 20s-40s into the a-minus one you'd consider in the teens, though. so we have a young player with a booming shot, a good two-way game, plus skating and good hockey iq… but what are the issues? the main aspect of his game that needs improvement to reach his potential is his decision making when on the puck. he has a tendency to take to much time to make a play for a player with a seemingly good hockey iq who both understands seams on ice as well as defensive coverages and opposition goalies it is also slightly concerning that often misses clear high-danger passes. a skilled puck-handler and effective physical presence, is most admired for his vicious and accurate shot. strong on the puck, he doesn't shy away from confrontation in the dirty areas. the imposing winger scored nine goals and 11 assists in 15 games with skellefteå's junior team, and earned a 22-game run at the pro level. another round in the will help further season game. his skating could use some refining. has a wide array of shots in his arsenal and isn't shy about pulling the trigger either. they're the weapons around which might build an nhl career. he wants to play a high-paced, rush-style of offence, but a propensity to drop his head when pressured could limit how far that takes him at the next level. there's a nice collection of tools here, as checks out with average or better tools grades almost across the board. our group was optimistic about coming into this season, but we most of our viewings wanting to see more from this winger. is your typical jack-of-all-trades winger. when he was on his game last season, there was a lot to like. he just wasn't on his game all that often. even so, some distinctly positive qualities revealed themselves in the good and the bad viewings alike. his shot, in particular, is an nhl-calibre tool that he isn't shy about leveraging against unsuspecting goaltenders. he's got the full array of weapons at his disposal: snapshots, slap shots, one-timers, wrist shots, one-touch ﬁnishes. it's all there. he pushes his top hand from his body and fully engages the lever-motion downforce on his stick for a mechanically clean shot with plenty of zip and accuracy. it's easily the most projectable tool in his toolbox. couples that shot with savvy off-the-puck timing to make him a consistent scoring threat in the offensive zone. and he's really great at using the threat of his plus-level shot to open up passing options; it's one of those instances where his strength in one area opens up possibilities in another. elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell said it best in a mid-season game report, “he's more dangerous without the puck than with it.” whether that's a compliment of play off-the-puck or an indictment of his play without it is the big question. we'd call it a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b. the problem is that doesn't really plan many of his touches or register the position of opposition defenders before the puck lands on his stick. if he's not immediately collecting the puck for a shot, then the game starts to move a little too fast for him to keep up, and he's soon out of options and without possession. it's not necessarily a pace issue so much as a vision one. just doesn't seem to catch most opportunities to create through his linemates with give-and-goes or one-touch passes unless they're blatantly obvious or directly in front of him. “he needs to reﬁne his offensive habits, pre-scanning, his awareness of his space, of defenders, and increase his pace,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a february game report. “but when he has his options in front of him, he uses them, give-and-gos, cross-ice passes, and changes the point of attack to reposition inside space. he plays more like a scorer than a playmaker, more at ease hunting those openings than creating passing seams.” may not project as a dual-threat scorer, but he's going to ﬁt into the nhl as a two-way forward. he's probably one of the better defensive wingers in the entire draft. our partners at instat hockey tracked time with skellefteå in the last season, and the results were pretty staggering. ﬁnished with a minus-seven shot attempt differential at 5-on-5, but he ﬁnished with a plus-18 unblocked shot attempt differential. the takeaway? skellefteå may have suffered a slight deﬁcit in overall possession when was on the ice, but they didn't give up much in the way of threatening looks. the hope for whichever team drafts is that some of the skills he ﬂashed in his draft-minus-one season will become a permanent facet of his game. you couple that with an nhl-level shot, strong defensive habits, and a high-level work rate, and you're cooking with ﬁre. the top of an nhl lineup might be out of the question, but has all of the tools and gumption to hang in a checking depth role. that seems like the baseline for , and anything extra is found money. is an excellent two-way forward who has middle-six nhl potential. an elite skater with a high compete level, is constantly aware of his surrounding in all three zones. he plays a simple game that scouts love. there is a low-risk element to his game, which some teams will love. he is a player without a ton of flash, but he can play anywhere in the line-up and make those around him better in all situations. there are portions of his game similar to the likes of mattias janmark and calle jarnkrok, though he is potentially a better skater than both players. some scouts have questions surrounding ability to produce offensively at the nhl level. he struggled in top league on the offensive side. however, this is an area that will likely come with time and increased opportunity. projects as a middle-six forward at the nhl level. he will need a few years of before he is nhl-ready. is a big and heavy winger who plays with a lot of power. as a typical power forward, he is not afraid to play physical and get into dirty areas. he is also very strong along the boards and uses his strength and size to protect the puck when carrying it in both acceleration and high speed. has a high-end motor and three-zone awareness, helping him to be effective all over the ice and on every shift. he applies tons of pressure on opponents with his pace and focus, and with great routes and positioning, whether that's deep in the offensive zone or high in the defensive zone. he contributes consistently, from stealing and winning pucks to killing penalties. handles the puck very well in stride and likes to challenge opponents and he is a threat in every shift when he moves over the offensive blue line. has a high hockey-iq and knows where he has his teammates and when to pass the puck or when to hold on to it. he often makes quick decisions and opens up the game with diagonal passes through the zone. he shows great creativity and offensive awareness in attacking the middle on first touches, which create openings for himself and his teammates. he plays inside the dots on offense and looks for deflections. has powerful strides, which helps him reach his impressive top speed. his agility really helps him to change skating directions quickly, which makes him especially hard to defend against when entering offensive zone. he has a fantastic flow in his feet and shows great balance. his shot and his ability to always be around goal scoring opportunities make him a constant threat. he has a quick release, it's very hard and he shoots the puck with accuracy. he can make some dangerous shots and passes, but isn't particularly elite at either. his passes are accurate and hard, without being a trait that truly stands out. he throws his body around from time to time, though he doesn't have the muscle mass to be a physical difference-maker. could improve his defensive game by showing more urgency when defending. the swede is a very well-rounded prospect that will likely be carried to the next level by his competitive nature and ability to contribute in all three zones.\n",

            " brings a lot of pace to his shifts. he's an excellent skater who can generate a lot of controlled exits and entries due to his skating. he has good enough skill to carry and create offense, and displays good poise as a passer. biggest issue is his frame as he barely measures at 5-foot-10, but he's a highly competitive player who can land surprising hits for his size. he has a chance but given he's not that dynamic offensively and undersized he's not a sure thing to make it. a no. 1 pick into the himself, has always been a draw for his offensive skill. but he's also a stocky, athletic kid who is the most physically well-built prospect i've come across in this draft class. there's some risk-taking that comes with his game but as he learns to simplify a bit, he's got the makings of both a modern and throwback d (he does not shy away physically despite his size). his head is always up, his shot pops and he's not afraid to use it. he's eager to activate up ice and join the rush or lead a transition sequence, he side-steps pressure with ease, and while i wouldn't say he's fast, his stride is compact and balanced through forward and backwards pushes and aggressive and almost choppy through his crossovers (in part because of how darn big and strong he is for his size). he more than held his own defensively this season, too, which bodes well for his abili to translate the rest of his game up levels. there were times this season where i actually wanted him to play a little looser and attacking because i think he's capable of even more offensively than his 61 points in 79 games already reveal, but some of that is the system they play in north bay. here's how describes himself: “i'm a two-way defenceman. i love to play in the offensive zone and control the pace of the game. i'm the power-play quarterback but i can also be the shutdown defenceman and block a shot when needed and take a hit to make a play. i love bringing the physical aspect as well.” , who was a no. 1 overall pick in the draft, has offensive skill for days and is aggressive in getting up in the play. he struggles with the defensive elements of the game and at times makes the wrong decisions with the puck. the talent level is there for him to be an effective offensive player, but i have enough concern about his overall hockey sense. is a defenceman who subverts expectations. everything about his profile suggests that he's an offensive blueliner in the making, whether it's his draft pedigree as a former first overall pick, his 5-foot-8 frame, or the 51 points he amassed in 66 games for the north bay battalion in his draft year. we used to view him in this light too, assigning the no. 24 overall ranking on our first board back in november. at least, we were open to the possibili, even if proof of concept eluded us in many of our viewings. as the unremarkable offensive performances accumulated, we eventually had to move on from any previously held notions concerning this player's profile, though. \"still waiting to see offensive skill,\" elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitch brown lamented in a january report. \"he can hammer the puck, occasionally set up a teammate on the inside, and activates somewhat regularly. but he mostly chooses to do the first one. sometimes, he shows a more complex passing idea, but his pass is so far from his target it makes me wonder if he actually sees options.\" many of those same issues rear their head in transition, where regularly mishandles the puck or fails to connect on the simplest of breakout plays. his skating skill should make him one of the better puck-movers in the but instead brown's manually tracked data set places him in the 61st percentile among chl/ushl defenders last season. the only part of game that consistently drew strong reviews from our staff was his play in the defensive zone. no complaints there. the battalion defender gaps up early in the neutral zone, keeps pace with pacey attackers and manages to make stops consistently. you'd never guess was 5-foot-10 based on the way he contains along the walls and comes away with possession from most puck battles. if there's a future for at the nhl level, that's it -- as an undersized defensive savant with perhaps some utili in transition with a little careful to that part of his game. he has a long way to go before he's there, though. is a small, skilled blue-liner with high offensive skill. unlike lane hutson however, is physically strong, and his lack of size appears to be less of an issue with his game. calling card is his offensive game, and he plays a high-risk-high reward sle of play. he also isn't afraid to engage physically, and his strong balance allows him to out-muscle taller opponents. some scouts have concerns surrounding skating, especially his top speed. that being said, he isn't necessarily a bad skater either. sle of play fits his skating abili, making him less of a liabili. he can quarterback a powerplay as well and relishes the role. projects as a second-pairing defender at the nhl level. he is likely 3-4 years away from competing for an nhl spot. is an offensive defender that loves to activate himself into the rush using his skating abili. he has strong skating abili, using his powerful lower body to generate powerful strides, allowing him to get up to full speed quickly. when he has the puck on his stick he's displayed high-end vision with the puck, finding teammates on the move and hitting them with crisp and accurate passes in stride. defensively he's a bit of a mixed bag, but because of his skating abili and vision on the ice he shows a knack for being a successful rush defender. he uses his skating abili and body positioning to angle defenders into the boards and he gets his stick into the lanes to take away passes and knock the puck off opponents sticks. his game really starts to struggle when the opposing team gets the puck below the goal line and starts to operate out of the cycle. he seems a step behind the play when it comes to his processing speed and it really hurts him in the defensive zone as he has a tendency to wander out of position and overcommit to the puck, allowing his assignment to get open and generate a quali scoring chance. his defensive zone play did improve as the season progressed, which is a big positive for his future outlook and draft status and if he does continue to show steady improvement he can easily become the top-four defenseman he is projected to be by scouts. the nhl draft is loaded with two-way defensemen, and given his skillset and the fact that he's a right-shot blueliner will certainly make appealing to scouts. he can be a solid five-on-five defender and play a significant role on the power play if he continues that and reaches his full potential at the next level.\n",

            " was easy to spot even in games because of how powerful an athlete he is. he would often be the guy to wind it up in his own end to carry the puck due to his great speed and skill. has a strong 6-foot-1 frame, isn't afraid to attack the hard areas, and can win some battles versus men as a 17-year-old. attacks with speed and skill, and while he can pull up to make a play or use his hard shot, his direct style of play will translate to the nhl. he projects as a quality top-two line you won't find anyone in the with the austrian hockey federation, or working for an nhl club in amateur scouting who doesn't like game and approach to it. he really impressed scouts all year with the way he managed one of the world's top pro levels, but especially in the playoffs, where he was really good by any measure for a player his age (before holding his own at men's worlds). i love his patience with the puck. he doesn't shy away from trying to beat or out-wait guys (whether through changes of directions out of stop-ups or curls) and he's got a really low panic threshold. he's also a good skater who never lacks in effort and always stops on pucks. he's an advanced 200-foot forward (it's worth pointing out that while he's listed as a centre by nhl central scouting and often discussed as one, he actually played exclusively the wing this year) who was able to progress up levels because of his rounded game. and while he looks a little skinny out there, he's feisty and he fights off his fair share of checks to stay on pucks. there's also a bit of a hunch to his stride but he leverages his edges well, building speed through the neutral zone to push pace with the puck. i don't see game-breaking skill or finishing, per se, but he plays with pro pace, he's a good passer, he plays on the interior, and makes plays all over the ice. he projects as a contributing nhl player. is one of my favorite prospects in this class. he has everything that you want in a power forward. the grit, the decision making and the speed. has the potential to be a top six forward in the nhl and his grit will intrigue plenty of teams. if a nhl team is looking to obtain a well-rounded power forward who can be annoying in high danger situations with his reach, is the guy. among the most well-rounded two-way centers in this class, plays an especially mature game and just got better and better as the year went on. he averaged 11:44 for rogle in the regular season, then saw his ice time increase to 14:16 per game in the postseason where he had six points in 13 games for one of the league's top teams. has good defensive skills and commitment to playing an all-around game. it took him a while to find his footing offensively in the playing against men, but he got there and by the end of the season looked not only like he belonged, but that he could start executing at the level that made him a factor in games. he maximizes his 6-foot-1 frame and has a little bit of edge to his game. there is absolutely no quit in him on or off the puck, which makes him a bear to play against. as he gets more confident, the offensive numbers are going to come because he has the skill and skating ability to take his numbers to another level in the coming years. all he needs is a little more patience, a little more strength and more ice time and it should come for him. there are few 18-year-olds who play as mean-spirited and pace-driven a game at the professional level as does. the heavy centre is loaded with tools and while none may be all that electric, he's extremely translatable. overly tenacious but with an intelligence to it. high floor, but of a lower ceiling, and a future fan-favourite. if you're looking for a throwback forward in this year's draft, look no further. is as violent and competitive a hockey player as you'll find in the entire class. he plays every shift like it's his last and it's taking place in game 7 of the stanley cup final. nearly every one of our staff's viewings starts with the austrian winger taking a run at someone on his first shift, and the hits just keep on comin'. they're a part of his game from puck drop to the final horn, no matter the score or the stakes. as elite prospects dir. of north scouting noted in a mid-season scout's notebook article, there's a real method to the madness, too. \" physicality isn't mindless. it's integral to his game. he seems to thrive when turning hockey into pinball,\" wrote. \"because when he's locked into the physical aspect, he's also winning footraces on pucks, turning board battles into inside-lane attacks, and stretching the ice with well-timed sprints to the opposing blue line.\" it's the net-front where sturdy, physical brand of hockey is most effective, though. just check out the instat shot chart from all of the 6-foot-1 winger's season, and you'll find that only three of the 19 goals he scored last year occurred away from the blue paint. that he managed to play such a taxing game almost exclusively in professional men's league settings this year -- internationally and at the club level alike -- just makes it that much more impressive. there's punching above your weight, and then there's what did with rogle bk and austria this season. and while it may have been true at one point this season that game lacked another dimension to add to his physicality and close quarters scoring, that's no longer the case. his skill and sense are never going to rate as elite-level tools at the professional level, but they've grown to the point where they're now comfortably average-to-above-average projections. his rush patterns through the neutral zone are far more diverse and manipulative than the straight-line attacks of the season's first few months, and his pace with the puck has followed a similar trajectory. some of the more advanced playmaking opportunities still elude , but he's regularly finding teammates through traffic and even showing a bit of a delay game with the puck. you just can't tell the story of season without acknowledging the leaps and bounds that he's made with the puck on his stick. at this point, there just aren't many holes in his game, period. every tangible component of his profile is at an average-to-slightly-above-average level, and the intangibles are all at an elite level. you talk to the people who've gotten to know the person as much as they have the player, and they just rave about his work ethic, coachability, competitive nature, and generally great demeanour. the next bad thing we hear about will be the first. where we once saw as a bottom-six, checking line winger at the nhl level, he's grown so much in such a short time that a complementary role in a team's top-six doesn't seem out of the question. and there are many teams in the league who hold him in even better esteem, so don't be sur-prised when he goes higher than where we've ranked him. is a player that is likely to be taken around the tenth pick in the draft, even with low offensive numbers. the austrian played in all situations in top league, however, and showed an ability to play a strong two-way game. plays which will bode well for his name being called early in the 2022 draft. overall, plays a well-rounded game in all three zones. he's tenacious on the forecheck, competes at a high level, and is defensively responsible. scouts have made note all season that plays a highly mature game. he is patient with the puck as well and can set up and break up plays with ease. loves to play close to the blue paint and isn't afraid to chase pucks into tough areas. he did this against men last season and was dominant at times, meaning he could continue to be dangerous this way at a higher level as he develops. the biggest question surrounding is his upside, particularly his offensive ceiling. projects as an nhl player, but there are questions as to whether he is a top-six or bottom-six forward. i personally project as a middle-six forward at the nhl level, a player who can pitch in offensively while simultaneously remaining defensively sound. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. is a speedy and skilled forward with so much to like in his game. with a strong willingness to play in the high-danger areas of the ice, he will take a beating to create scoring chances and drive offense. playing at an extremely high pace, his feet are constantly moving, and he's able to build up a ton of speed quickly through crossovers and quick cuts. his speed makes him difficult to defend on the rush as he can easily beat defenders wide when attacking the zone. when going wide isn't an option, he has the puck skills to play one-on-one and beat his man with the use of quick hands. with how intense he plays, it's no surprise that he thrives in tight spaces where his high-end motor enables him to drive through checks and win battles on the board for possession of the puck. he doesn't back down or shy away in these instances one bit. because of this skill, he directly makes positive impacts to his teams overall possession time while on offense. he doesn't have the greatest velocity on his shot, however, which limits his effectiveness from further out when putting the puck on net. this is something he will eventually get better at as he builds up strength but again, he succeeds because of how well he is able to get to the front of the net. with how strong his effort level is, it's no surprise that he is already showing signs of a solid two-way player. he's got some versatility as well, with the option of placing him down the middle or on the wing depending on the set of circumstances. the offensive production may never be elite at the nhl level for him, but the micro-stats is where will be very impactful given his willingness and determination to attack with ferocity.\n",

            " has intrigued nhl teams because of his significant athletic tools. he's 6-foot-4 and a good skater for his size, and it's possible the skating gets even better given he's one of the younger players in the draft. when you see a guy his size easily closing a gap or rushing a puck up the ice, you can see how it translates to the higher levels. with his reach and feet, he is quite solid defensively and projects to make stops at the higher levels. has good flashes with the puck. i've seen him occasionally stretch the ice or make a very creative play from the offensive blue line, which is why i have his iq at 60, but i did so with hesitancy. i wouldn't call him a natural puck-mover though. i could see him becoming a real player from what i've seen of his best days, but i want to see those best days more consistently. when you're 6-foot-4 and your four-way mobility is a strength, you've got my attention. still has some work to do to round out his game with the puck. he can look off-balance through his shot, which speaks to some technique that needs cleaning up because he's not getting the most out of his big frame. but he can make plays, his head is always up, he's got enviable length and he's only going to get better. the combination of his late july birthday and his exciting combination of skills suggests he's just scratching the surface. there's more work to be done with game than there is with the other top d in this draft, though. he makes a lot of mistakes with the puck and i've seen some boneheaded reads. whichever team takes him will be trusting their player to tap into his obvious upside. is a physical freak. he has a beautiful stride, and is very mobile and agile. the big blue-liner is also a very confident player, who likes to rush the puck up ice, and can dangle when he needs to. his transition play can be a job to behold as he scythes through pressure in the neutral zone. he also has a nice shot, and is good at quarter-backing a power-play once it is set up. however, at 5v5 the creatively he brings in man-up situations is not as noticeable, and at 5v5 he can go completely missing in terms of his offensive game once through the neutral zone, barring a big shot here or there. at times his offensive iq in ev situations seems to be a question, with poor decision making and not seeing a play developing in front of him. defensively is very solid, even versus men in the allsvenskan. he can be physical and deliver big hits, even if he does not look to engage on a regular basis. the big swede also has an active stick that he uses very well at his own blue-line, and is good at channelling opponents to the areas he wants them to be when he has his gap. he is also, however, prone to inconsistency, and at times gets outsmarted or overwhelmed in all zones playing against men. some of this may well be due to the fact he is a late-bloomer, who does not have the experience playing at a high level prior to this season many of his peers have, as before this season he had only played two superelit games. is a project, who will certainly take time and patience to develop, but it is easy to see him becoming a great middle pairing defenseman with the combo of size, skating and skill. there's a lot of projecting to do in game, as there's a bit of rawness to him. he has a big frame but needs to tack on some muscle. and while he has some intriguing offensive skills, he needs to finish plays better than he does. i need to see a little more from in terms of hockey sense, and he could clean up his skating more to project more favorably. but there's enough to like here on potential alone. if you're reading this draft guide one profile after the other, then think of modo defender as similar to joni jurmo but slightly worse, at least in our estimation. if you're not reading this draft guide as we'd intended for it to be read, then step into my office -- it's time to look at brings to the table. this kid can really move, and he's a gangly, lanky lad to boot. towers over the competition, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 194 pounds -- there's plenty of room for him to fill out that frame. that's a combo that's always going to bring boys to the yard, where boys to the yard, in this instance, are scouts to 6rnsk6idsvik arena to watch modo's j20 superelit team play hockey. depending on what games they attended, these scouts could leave their viewings thinking that is a future top-pairing defenceman at the nhl level or a dnd-grade (dnd stands for do not draft) prospect to avoid this october. that variance shows up well on the eliteprospects 'draft center' page, where is ranked as high as 18th-overall by one outlet and as low as 57th overall on the low-end of that range. the one constant? through the good and the bad performances alike -- always skates well. he skates well enough that christoffer hedlund, our dir. of european scouting based in made him one of the only players with a 7-grade or higher for skating. \" is such an unbelievably smooth skater with a fluid stride,\" hedlund noted in his year-end player report. \"he might be the most technically skilled skater among all defenceman in this draft. uses long strides to gather speed but short-quick strides to navigate through traffic. \"he accelerates very well for a player of size,\" hedlund continued. \"he'll probably be even faster once he adds more lower-body strength. we haven't seen him at his fastest yet.\" now, if only skated with a purpose. another consistent theme through many of our viewings was an effort level that would make orange cassidy beet red ... cassidy. \" doesn't compete much in his own zone, can float around, and often looks totally unengaged,\" hedlund wrote. \"he lacks that burning competitive fire to beat his opponents, whether it's defending the inside lane near the net-front or battling for a puck along the boards - - you rarely, if ever, get a full effort from .\" the real question is whether one would even notice if started applying himself more consistently on a shift-to-shift, night-to-night basis, particularly in the defensive zone. defensive instincts are, regrettably, every bit as poor as his habits. \"he plays a horrendous positional game,\" hedlund wrote in player report. \"he can be all over his own zone, just wandering aimlessly, looking completely los, and not covering anyone in particular. \"his decision-making in the defensive zone is just so very, very poor. wal linder often the slot completely unattended to chase pucks all the way on the other side of the zone. on other occasions, he was guilty as sin of puck-watching.\" as hedlund notes in many of his game reports, isn't much better through the neutral zone, where his exceptional skating should make him an absolute force. he plays far too accommodating a gap, doesn't mitigate risk with his footwork, spaces himself poorly, and commits far too early. it's worth noting that improved defensively over the course of the season but not by much. for additional context, modo's j20 team was a bit of a disaster defensively, and didn't look quite as permissive in the allsvenskan. that's about as complimentary or accommodating as it's going to get for wal linder's play in the defensive third though. let's take a step back into the pros column, though, because has shown some capability playing in the offensive zone. he's an alright finisher from the point, leaning more on his wrist shot than his slap shot, and showing some capability with the one-timer. 'there's good accuracy on wrist shot, along with decent power. but it's far from a laser,\" hedlund wrote. \"taking a i ittle time off of the release would help him a bit here, both to get those point shots through traffic and to take away time from the goa i tender.\" where is most productive, though, is on the rush. he's a great puck-carrier, eager to leader his team up the ice, and with a great deal of initiative in creative offensive chances. barring that, is all too happy to join the second-wave as a trailer. the consistency of his passes leave a lot to be desired, but there's no denying the way that he sees the ice. has strong offensive instincts, of this much there is no doubt. ultimately, though, we see the most likely career outcome for as a no. 4 or 5 defenceman with puck-moving upside primarily, and offensive value secondarily. the lack of a finishing component really hurts his projection here, as does his unspectacular in-zone offensive contributions. is a player with large frame, but despite that, he shows good footwork and good agility as he can move smoothly in every direction. his first steps are not the best, but he has decent acceleration and good top speed, though he could improve these qualities, especially his first steps. he skates smooth when he turns both with and without puck. he can play a two-way game and plays in all situations. while he doesn't take any risks in his own zone, he always stands up against an opponent when he feels safe to do so. he seems to have good work ethic and works hard along the boards and is very effective with the poke checks because of his long reach. he could use his strength better when he battles along the boards. he shows that he has good vision and can read the play. he can also be a puck-moving defenseman, but he has some problems with puck control when he reaches his top speed and therefore loses the puck from time to time. his passing is not very creative; he likes to keep it simple and with that comes safe passes with good accuracy. when he is calm, he makes good decisions but when he is under pressure, he can tend to make bad passes that cause turnovers. offensively, he has a hard shot and uses it in the moments. he plays a confident offensive game. overall, a non-flashy defenseman who can do the job without taking any risks.\n",

there's no denying his hot start to the season though, lighting the lamp twice on opening night en route to six goals through his first ten games. that was just a sign of things to come. finished the year one short of the 40-goal mark, and added a handful of assists over last season in six fewer games. he's a pure sniper with one of the best shots in his entire draft class, as noted by the eight shooting grade that our scout rachel doerrie meted to the sarnia product. this segment from a player report doerrie wrote in november does a good job of detailing the extent of his arsenal. \" has one of the best shots in this draft class. it's accurate, hard and he can score from anvwhere. he can score from both sides off of the rush, one-timers, quick shots off of faceoffs, and off of rebounds in front of the net. his nose for the net and quick hands in tight make him a threat from anywhere in the offensive zone. his ability to catch and shoot pucks in stride when the passes aren't in the wheelhouse is a transferable skill that will serve him well.\" the backhand shot -- a long lost art-form -- is just another feather in perreau it's game and one he uses to catch goaltenders off guard from time-to-time. my personal favourite is when he drops the shoulder as if to give the appearance of protecting the puck, only to let a backhand shot off as the goaltender's let their guard down. even if there wasn't a massive jump in assists: we've identified playmaking as an area of growth this season. \"his distribution skills have improved,\" doerrie remarked. \"he's making the players around him better because of the scoring chances he's creating.\" still, there is room for growth. \"he can control defenders, but sometimes misses slot-cutting teammates or better positioned ones on the flank as he tries to dangle too many defenders,\" remarked in a game report. \"he could also become guilty of forcing passes at the next level as defenders better anticipate what he wil i do next.\" there's some debate over how to rate skating though. that's less clear to our staff. there are mechanical inconsistencies in the way he covers the ice, particularly in the stutters that often arise in his crossovers. his stride recovery there weren't many strong puck-carriers on sarnia -- ryan mcgregor had moments, i guess? that meant that took on a massive burden in transition, and he handled it with aplomb. the numbers that collected from the chl+usntdp u18 team this season place in the top-quartile for all three of the entry statistics his project accounts for -- controlled entries per hour, controlled entries relative percentage, and successful controlled entries relative percentage. it's fair to wonder how much of his production can be attributed to playing on a sting team that absolutely, undeniably played a system that was perfectly suited to his style -- or the absence of a system, depending on your mileage. doesn't just about every prospect come with their own contextual question marks though? lands a bit high and wide, limiting his acceleration in space. even so, achieves the desirable flexion at all three points, and he's got a great deal of lower-body strength. too. i've seen accelerate as if shot from a cannon and just explode up-ice at a breakneck pace. i haven't seen it often, but i've definitely seen it. pathway to imrpovement as skater is pretty straightforward. everything else, and his shot especially, is at a relateively high level. he has all the makings of a top-six scorer if he continues to develop at this rate. scouts are all over the place on , even though he has shown he can produce offensively in the past. is a pure goal-scorer but is an above-average passer as well. his point totals suggest any question marks surrounding his offensive game and skating can be put aside. he looks, at worst, like a middle-six goal-scoring winger, and at best a top six. creative winger with well-rounded offensive instincts and skill, shows tremendous anticipation and vision with the puck on his stick and can navigate around defenders in traffic with ease thanks to his exceptional timing, smooth skating, quick crossovers and speedy reflexes. while his skating isn't at an elite level and he doesn't have a lot of jump off the top, he is strong on his skates and does a nice job of moving the puck when he gets going. has a strong shot with high power and a quick release, which he relies on heavily as he likes to set up down low for one-timer opportunities. he also does a nice job of moving the puck and keeping the play alive with sharp and accurate passes when the shooting opportunities aren't there. he identifies passing lanes and makes crisp passes, but he isn't one to dazzle as a distributor. he has some bouts of inconsistency, but when he is fully engaged, he is often the most dangerous player on the ice. his effort also lacks at times in his own end, but he generally gets his stick into the passing lanes and has the skill to win loose puck battles and races. he uses his sturdy frame to box players out of board battles or in front of the net. overall, he is a dangerous goal scorer when engaged and if he puts forward a consistent effort in all areas of his game, he will be a great offensive addition.\n",

            " a talented player who had a good season but didn't play as well as expected before tearing it up in the playoffs. the pure tools scream first-round pick. he's 6-foot-4, skates well for a big man and has a high skill level. there are times when you see him come down the wing, power his way to the net or make a skilled play to create a chance and you think that translates to an nhl scorer. he flashes high-end puck skills but it hasn't been consistent. he's got a hard shot and scored quite a few goals this season from long distance. as a late 2000 birth date on a good team, his production (32 goals-73 points in 62 games) was mediocre for a projected top talent. this reflects a consistency problem in his game at times, as well as the fact that scouts aren't the biggest fans of his decision-making. i've seen good vision from him, and thus give him a 55 on his sense, but it's with hesitation as i've seen many instances where he throws pucks away or forces plays that aren't there he has some physicality, he defends fine and his coach this season trusted him with pk responsibilities. he has a ton of potential and ended his season with several exclamation marks. i spent most of this draft year admittedly sour on game. he's one of the oldest players in the draft, he's one of the biggest players in the draft, he has the talent needed to be an unstoppable force at the junior level and yet that just never materialized … until the playoffs. threw the mooseheads over his shoulders and dragged them into their final against the rouyn-noranda huskies by racking up a qmjhl-leading 17 goals and 27 points through 17 games in the first three rounds. his nearest halifax teammate, ducks second-round pick antoine morand, had 12 fewer points during that 17-game stretch. that's insane. the biggest challenge with is differentiating between how much of it is skill and how much of it is a combination of the fact that he's nearly a year older than some of the other players on this list (he'll be 19 during his first nhl training camp) and boasts an overwhelming physical dominance. increasingly, though, his skill has begun to shine through. he gets to the net at will and he has the ability to finish plays in tight by pounding home rebounds or using some impressive stick handling to beat goalies with a deke. fluctuating draft stock has been the norm for this season, but i think he did himself a lot of favors with his postseason performance. with 20 goals in 23 games for halifax on the way to the finals, showed a good mix of skill and power. he's a big kid who moves well and can outmuscle opponents. there's room for him to fill out and become a better power forward down the line. plays with some edge, and competes, but i think there were times this season when he didn't dominate the way many scouts believed he could. he still had a lot of success, but there is room for improvement. what i've seen over these past two years is pretty impressive from . he keeps getting better. powerful forward boasts a deadly release that's as heavy as it is accurate. protects the puck well and forces his way into dangerous areas. just 10 days shy of being eligible for the 2018 crop. gets around well for his size, but quicker acceleration is needed. a complete power forward with great speed, he can always keep up with other top-end skaters. his speed allows him to create smooth zone entries, although while he has a quick stride, it's not overly powerful. he has a great shot with a quick release, but it doesn't always hit the net. with great stickhandling and ease, he is able to create scoring chances for his teammates. he has great strength and can protect his puck at all costs using his body and positioning when entering the zone. his hockey iq allows him to find loose pucks around the crease and cash in on them. he's excellent on the forecheck with his strength and long reach, often keeping the puck in the offensive zone. he backchecks with intensity. he always looks if a player is alone in the slot and will cover him when needed. he is defensively sound and won't hurt his team with bad assignment coverage or turnovers in the neutral zone. he's conscious, intelligent and relentless before he gets the puck. he wins most of his puck battles and is always ready for a breakout pass. his ability to get back into the play rarely leaves him out of position. he needs to work on his body language when things aren't going his way and his overall confidence, but has loads of skills to build upon.\n",

            " has drawn a lot of interest from nhl teams because he's a 6-foot-3 with a high skill level. with his hands and reach he's able to consistently maneuver pucks through sticks and legs to create chances. he's a big man who doesn't shy away from physical contact, which combined with his skill makes him tough to deal with down low and strip the puck from in general. can make plays and run a power play, showing good vision and finish from the perimeter. his main flaw, like his brother morgan's was, is his skating. he's a better skater than his brother and can separate occasionally at the level but doesn't project to do so in the nhl. projects as a middle-six with a chance to play higher in the lineup. is a big centre with clear skill as a handler and passer. i debated ranking him as high as no. 13 here as a result. but his modest production this season and a few uninspiring viewings (after an excellent rookie year) me just a little more hesitant about him than the three names ahead of him here. he's got impressive hands and body control for his size, which helps him control pucks inside the offensive zone and make plays while also getting the upper hand in board battles. he plays through bumps and thrives taking pucks from the cycle to dangerous areas. he also skates well enough for his size. it's certainly not going to be a strength but i don't see it as the huge issue that some do and i think he moves better than his big brother morgan (now with the kraken) did at the same age, and creates his fair share pushing up ice in transition as a result. i do find he forces things too much by trying to go one-on-one and create something that's not there, and there's a bit of a hunch to his stride that will need straightening out. he's got some work to do in the faceoff circle, too. but it's hard to deny the impressive size-hands combination he has considering his length. he's got a real ability to hang onto the puck, draw players into him, and then facilitate through or around them. he makes an unusual amount of soft little plays for a player his size, and can attack into coverage because of his hands. he's really quite comfortable in control of the puck. a legitimate prospect with a desirable set of skills. i hinted at my projection for earlier. i believe that can be a top line nhl player if his skating gets to be nhl average or better. that's the biggest question, though. can improve his skating enough in order to be effective at the nhl level? or a better question might be this: how will adapt and change his game once the competition gets bigger, faster, and stronger? he isn't going to be able to run over the competition for much longer, and his effort level sure as hell won't cut it in the pros. there are times when i'm enamored with skill level. he thinks the game ahead of players and creates a lot of high danger chances. when he's on his game, looks like a legitimate top ten pick. when he's off his game, however, looks like a player that i'd avoid entirely if i were drafting in the top 20. yes, the size and skill combination will be enticing for an nhl team, but the risks in his game make me wary of his odds at making a big splash in the nhl. if i'm being honest, i haven't liked very much this season. i see the skill that others are seeing, and it's easy to look at his highlights and go “man, this kid has it.” but when i've watched play, i've seen an underwhelming player with very obvious flaws in his game that will affect his nhl chances. the skating is an obvious issue, but his effort level in the neutral and defensive zones concerns me even more. again, i don't want to call a lazy player, but his efforts in the defensive zone can definitely look lazy at times. then there's the issue of whether or not is an nhl moving forward. it's a major concern of mine that is not dictating the play when he's on the ice. he doesn't even carry the puck into the zone. i see him waiting for the play to come to him instead of actively seeking opportunities, making me question if he can be more than just a complementary player at the nhl level. if i were an nhl team with a top 20 pick, i would hesitate to draft . it's easy to be enamored with the size and skill, but under the surface, you have a player that's going to take a long time to get to a top six role at the nhl level. could easily peak as a third line player in the nhl, which, in this scout's opinion, is not worth a top 20 pick. again, the upside is there, but there are a lot of holes in game that could limit his effectiveness at the nhl level. poor skating is the biggest thing holding back from being one of the top-tier talents in this draft. it's a big issue, but i think he makes up for it with his intelligence. say what you want about his feet, but the puck is around him an awful lot. he puts himself in good positions, is aggressive enough to win puck battles and has the size to dominate in a lot of the tough areas of the ice. his hands are good enough to keep the opposition honest and he can drive the middle of the ice as well as anyone in this draft. i think could go higher than i have him here, but the skating continues to be my most fervent concern. that said, i still think all the other tools make him especially worthy of a first-round grade. a big, rangy pivot who can manipulate in tight spaces and sees the ice well. the footspeed and pace have long been documented as areas that need a lot of help, but defensive positioning and stick make his floor nice and safe. there's a wide range of outcomes here. there was a time this season when looked like a contender to crack the top-five in this year's draft. he may still get there. it only takes one team, after all. but it's far from a foregone conclusion, and even the top-10 may be out of reach at this stage. you can probably attribute some of that to the play of those who've passed him. there's been a lot of movement in his range, and i would describe his place on a shifting board more as other players rising rather than falling. sure, he cooled off as the season went on, capping it off with a sub-point per game performance in the playoffs, but we'd hardly say that his game fell off. not by any means. the reality is that we came to view projection as more of a two-way middle-six centre at the nhl level than a top-six power forward. for a group that covets upside, there just wasn't any way to justify placing him any higher on our board because of it. now, this isn't to suggest that the 6-foot-4 pivot is inept with the puck. there's some legitimate skill here, and it just may scale up to the nhl, too. hands are easily the best part of his offensive toolkit, with technique, precision, speed, agility, and range as a handler. it's just not often that you see a 6-foot-4 skater pull off some of the handling moves that graced his draft year highlight-reel. the problem is that the strathclair-born pivot relies far too frequently on that skill, defaulting to a handling manoeuvre in the face of any defensive pressure. there's some small area passing skill there as well, but far too often, the move was to try and swashbuckle his way past problems. only compounding matters is that so many of these dangles occur in a glide. the more projectable component of offensive profile is his playmaking, small area or otherwise. he has a knack for identifying passing options through layers and has the skill as a passer to connect, almost always with pace. it's not a high-end nhl projection, but it will be sufficient to put up points at a respectable clip in the big leagues all the same. more than anything, though, we're drawn to the ice centre's two-way game; his ability to play high-leverage minutes, kill penalties, and make life miserable for the opposition's best. he's a strong off-puck defender, who tracks well through the neutral zone and makes proactive reads in the defensive third. in close quarters defensive sequences, takes good lines on the puck, leads with his stick, closes with force, and doesn't give up on plays. you bank on that defensive projection, and then you work from there with . in the hands, with a staff that adds an extra gear as a skater and more discretion as a handler, perhaps a top-six projection is within reach. for now, we see him as more of a high-end middle-six player at the nhl level. whether you are looking for him or not, it's impossible to not notice when watching the winnipeg ice this season. while teammate matthew savoie stands out for his offense and agility, stands out for his size. at 6'4, towards over many of his peers and uses his size to his advantage. averaging over a point per game, has excellent puck skills for a big player. he excelled on the powerplay last season and protects the puck well. excels at drawing players to himself and then moving the puck to the open space he has just created. he also has a decent shot, though he does project more as a playmaker at the nhl level. the biggest question surrounding is his skating. he can get around okay but lacks high-end speed and his acceleration needs work. if he can improve even a little bit in this area, should settle in as a middle-six forward with offensive upside at the nhl level. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. connor is a who's combination of size and elite puck skills are unlike any other available in this year's class. he's a puck possession monster that causes major headaches for those trying to defend him. he uses his frame extremely well to shield the puck from others and create time and space. he has so many tools to use offensively – it's almost unfair to opponents when he has the puck. he can use his size to drive the puck to the net, has surprisingly soft hands for a guy his size, and is able to stickhandle his way through defenders. he also possesses a lethal wrister. it's a heavy heavy shot but his release is deceptive and seems effortless. another area he excels at is his play off the rush. he's a threat with the puck, but even without it he drives lanes with a purpose of either getting himself in a better scoring position or to occupy a defender and create more ice. even though he has all of these amazing offensive skills, there are two things that may hold him back from reaching his full potential. he doesn't have great acceleration, and his top speed isn't very high. he can just seem slow in general. it raises questions as to how effective he can be in a modern nhl that is based on speed. his compete-level is questionable, too. he's fantastic when he has the puck but when he doesn't, he too often seems disengaged with the play. he doesn't show much urgency in his own zone to provide support for his defensemen, and he's not really one to be the first guy in on the forecheck. put it all together and you get one of the most intriguing prospects. if is able to work on his skating and better his 200-foot game, the team that picks him may have snagged a top-six with huge offensive upside.\n",

            " is the first player to be given exceptional status to play in the as a 15-year-old. his production took off after a midseason trade to drummondville from saint john, but he's always been considered one of the best players in his age group. he is an excellent skater — particularly for a 6-foot-1 forward — and he gets up to top speed quite easily with a powerful stride. works hard and plays a powerful style on the puck without taking many bad penalties. i don't think he's a dynamic playmaker, but he's certainly above-average with the puck and can flash a tier higher. i like his puck skills, he's a very smart player and he can consistently make above-average plays. can he take a game over? that's the million dollar question with . there are moments where you watch him and think the answer is maybe, but more likely he'll just be an above-average skill guy. while his shot/finishing ability is a bit worrying, has the speed, skills, smarts and physicality to be a very good playmaker and zone entry artist as an nhler combined with being a reliable two-way that has a lot of value. is one of the best skaters in the class, not only at his top speed, but, more importantly, in the way he accelerates and changes pace with the puck — which allows him to control and dictate tempo. he backs defenders off, stops up and finds the trailer in the slot as well as anyone in this draft. i'd still like to see him shoot more and be more aggressive in attacking the low slot with possession when he has the step on a defenceman, but he doesn't have a heavy shot. he's a pass-first centre who is extremely committed to the defensive zone, uses his feet to be the first man back, wins races for loose pucks, and works hard to play within his team's systems. i don't think he has first line upside, but he can be the passer on my team's top pp unit and a contributing, detail freak, checking centre who can play up and down the lineup on my team any day. the best way to describe is probably \"well-rounded.\" he's not truly elite at any one thing, but he's effective in all zones, strong on the puck and committed to playing strong defensively. offensive skills are also strong, highlighted primarily by quick hands and some shiftiness. he also protects the puck with a strong frame and powerful skating. for as skilled as is, he has a strong defensive work ethic. i think one of the biggest questions surrounding is his year-to-year progression after being granted exceptional status to enter the a year early. he hasn't taken remarkably big steps forward as a player, which makes me wonder about his overall upside. that said, the level he's playing at now as a and the versatility he brings to the table are why i still have him a bit higher. the last four players to be granted that exceptional status were john tavares, aaron ekblad, mcdavid and sean day, and three of them went no. 1 overall in the nhl draft. a jack-of-all-trades player with a nice tool belt. great edgework, acceleration, vision and puck-protection skills. blazing fast in a straight line. the 18-year-old is already a consummate worker in the defensive end and is a very safe selection as he has a pro-level approach. one of the best power play distributors in the there is so much to like about . he's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better. the fleet-footed is unselfish and will primarily look to make a play at top speed; however, when the chance arises to put it in the pot himself, he will capitalize. he sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. his defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. all-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor. if he can find the consistency in refusing to let himself get taken out of plays, especially if he doesn't start them, he will thrive and exceed expectations. a terrific centerman, he is a great skater, with high-end top speed and extremely good mobility. he skates low with a wide stance, just like sidney crosby. his first steps and acceleration are breathtaking – not to mention one of his top assets. he can change pace, he can change directions, and he owns tremendous puckhandling skills. he's able to hold onto the puck at top speed with his head up. he protects the puck very well with his body and he can get into shooting position using his strong legs. he is incredibly smart, with and without the puck, and he knows how to feed his teammates. flashy, with an impressive shot. in tight space, he is an elite presence. working in one-on-one battles, his quick hands allow him to take hold of the puck more often than not. lots of speed, lots of skill, to go with a very high compete level. he's visible on every shift and involved in everything on the ice. even defensively, his work rate stands out. he forechecks and backchecks very hard. with a big hit or using his quick hands, he can often steal the puck. he never misses an opportunity to throw a bodycheck, although sometimes he crosses the line with hits from behind and boarding. is even good on the penalty kill. blocks shots, too. opportunities to grow as a leader for this ‘exceptional' standout.\n",

            " is an exciting defenseman. he plays with pace and is aggressive as a rusher. his skating allows him to evade pressure easily and transition pucks up ice with his feet. is also highly skilled and can make plays through legs and sticks. he shows good offensive iq, knowing when to activate and how to make plays with the puck. he also has a hard point shot, making him dangerous on the pp with his skating and vision. defensively he's solid, showing an ability to use his long reach, mobility and physicality to kill plays. he can be a little too aggressive at times trying to create offense when he leaves his defensive position. he projects as a top-four defenseman with the potential to play high in the lineup. , who was a top prospect in growing up, was supposed to make the jump from to the last season before it was shut down. it took me some time this year to warm up to him as a result, but he eventually made a fan of me and of the scouting community at large with his play in (though i remain a little lower than the consensus). is an adept three-zone player whose game tilts towards offensive through his eagerness to engage in transition and off the offensive zone blue line. when he's looking to be active, he can involve himself in all areas of the game. he's also talented as both a handler and shooter (though i think a couple of highlight-reel plays have exaggerated that a little). add in an athletic 6-foot-1 frame and there's a lot to like. i do think he can play a little too much on instinct at times (both on offence and on defence) though and that, in concert with the fact that he's a late birthday and should be further along in that regard, leaves me lower on him than the draft's other two top d out of the the hope is that he'll be able to develop the decision-making aspect a little and that when he does, he'll be able to contribute at both ends at five-on-five and potentially on both special teams as a top-four guy long term. with size, raw tools (including puck skill and passing ability), four-way agility, and deceptive maneuvering around the blue line: it's hard not to see a lottery selection on that assessment alone. there are not many players in this draft class that have the ability to operate in the offensive zone from the backend like can. add in his ability to suffocate space and his mobility to keep a tight gap: he's an attractive asset in the 2022 draft. as a life-long buffalo sabres fan, where i tend to get really hesitant with is his defensive zone awareness and propensity for chasing highlight reel hits rather than mitigating dangerous chances. it is all to reminiscent to watching rasmus ristolainen in a sabres uniform. the tools are there, he's a physical specimen, but too often i'm watching film of and trying to piece together the thought process behind some of his defensive reads. some of these issues lie within the structure of neutral and defensive zone set-up and skill set. however, a lot of it is individual reads that require if/then decisions that will too often not make correctly. if i'm drafting i'm leaning in heavily on his offensive ability and his ability to create space with his edges and skill. i think he can excel in a defensive system that doesn't lean so heavily on man-to-man defensive zone play. i would also spend a significant time in the film room showing how chasing hits in the neutral zone and at the defensive blue line has allowed teams to use it against him. if can make those adjustments i think he could end up being one of the better defenders to come out of the 2022 nhl draft. one of the best goal-scoring defensemen in this draft, navigates the offensive zone brilliantly from the blueline down. he walks the line well with good skating and crafty puck skills. when it comes to shooting, he always seems to find a better lane to make sure his chances are especially dangerous. there are so many instances this season of him making moves to the inside and getting closer to the net to maximize his potential to score. defensively he's adequate and played a boatload of minutes in key situations for a weaker team this season. i think he could be a top-four power-play weapon for a team that likes to activate its defensemen in the offense. insert a lot of what i just said about mateychuk onto but add more size, a more structured offensive style, and about eight months of maturation. the blueliner can get a bit hectic in the defensive end, but he brings a strong package to work with despite missing his entire draft-minus-one season. there's bouncing back from a lost year, and then there's what pulled off for the spirit last season. how's nearly a point a game clip on the fifth-lowest scoring side for bursting back onto the scene? just imagine what he would've done with the benefit of a draft-minus-one season under his belt... those gaudy point totals accurately reflect ability and the sort of future that awaits him in the nhl. he's an offensive defenceman by trade and one of the very best players with that profile in this year's draft. the tools are strong, but mainly relies on his cunning and guile to pick the opposition apart. his process-ing power is just miles ahead of most other players at this stage in their constant scanning off-the-puck and decisiveness with it made the blueliner one of the most effective high-pace creators in the last season. the one- and two-touch feed were his weapons of choice, and used them to strike with rapier-like precision through any cracks in the defensive formation. and when openings weren't already there, he made them with deceptive handling, look-offs, and feints. \" puck skill is unique for a defenceman,\" elite prospects dir. of north scouting wrote in a scout's notebook article on . \"he easily beats defenders with sound form, hand speed, and projectable setups. but he doesn't overuse them...he plays a give-and-go style, based on short- and medium-range passing, constant movement, and non-stop pressure.\" those puck skills and offensive blue line activations helped the 6-foot-1 defender nearly crest the 20-goal mark. and who knows, maybe he gets across that finish line with a better shot. if there's any weak point in tool kit, that's it -- particularly the wrister, limited by a reliance on a sweeping motion rather than generating lever-action with downforce. as one might imagine, those puck skills coupled with an enthusiasm for activating into the play made an exceptional puck-mover, too. he was downright clinical in transition, going through the motions on a breakout like they were routine; deceive on the retrieval, leave a forechecker or two behind with handling skill, and get the puck up ice with pace. it just looked easy for him. the same, of course, isn't true of his play in the defensive zone. has the tools to one day develop into an effective in-zone defender, but he's not quite there yet. he's far too puck-focused and reactive, doesn't time his close-outs well, and struggles to break down multivariable situations. we saw a fair bit of improvement from defensive-ly as the season progressed, but it's still far from a selling point to his game. here's the thing, though. you can teach a player with skill set how to defend at least at an adequate level, but you can't teach someone without his natural ability to create offence or transition the puck in the nhl. that makes the gamble worthwhile. and if you hit, then you're looking at a top-four defenceman with power play utility for many years to come. similar to korchinski, started the season outside the first round for many, and just like korchinski, his offensive production made it impossible for scouts not to notice him. averaged almost a point-per-game in the and on a struggling team. is a well-rounded offensive player and showed he can drive play at times in the he is comfortable rushing the puck and he is an excellent skater. he has a decent point shot as well and quarterbacks a powerplay with ease. biggest area of improvement is defensive awareness. it certainly isn't a weakness, but further awareness is needed in the defensive zone, and he needs to learn to pick his spots better when joining the rush. overall, he projects as a top-four defender. he is likely three years away from nhl duty. his combination of size and offensive ability should make him an early mid-round target for teams. is an offensive-minded defenseman who plays the game with an aggressive mindset. he uses his skating and offensive instincts to jump into the play every chance he can get. his vision and ability to read the defensive zone coverage are impressive for a blueliner. he can anticipate the play really well and adjust his positioning to get into a excellent position to create an offensive chance. when he's at his best, he has excellent playmaking instincts, and can manipulate passing lanes with his eyes and deliver crisp and accurate passes to his teammates in prime scoring areas. he has strong lateral mobility with the puck on his stick, making him a strong power play quarterback and facilitator from the top of the offensive zone. the concerns about him are mostly in relation to his high ‘boom or bust' label. he has flashes of being an elite offensive zone player, but he can go a long time without being at the top of his game. there are inconsistencies in his passing and puck-handling ability, and if he can find a way to level that off it will significantly impact his long-term outlook in appositive way. defensively he struggles to maintain solid gap control and at angling his opponents away from the perimeter. he's not a liability on defense, but goes through severe ups and downs when it comes to his defending. his game oozes confidence and he can process the game quickly, he just needs to improve on a few key defensive skills and consistency before jumping to the next level. has the potential to be a top-six, maybe even top-four blueliner at the nhl level who plays a significant role running a power play unit. if he doesn't develop, he may struggle to make any five-on-five impact.\n",

            " didn't have the best draft season he could have envisioned, mostly because he missed a substantial part of the season due to injury. however, he remains a top prospect. best trait is his hockey sense. he's a highly creative playmaker, with high-end vision and puck skills. he can dictate the tempo of a game, with pro-level pace in his decisions and the ability to slow the play and find his options. also shows an above-average shot and can generate it from tight spaces. his skating isn't as dynamic as his playmaking, as it's more about pro average than top level, but he'll be able to keep up in the nhl. he's a player without a glaring flaw, as he'll be what you want in a top-level center: a two-way forward with skill, size and intelligence who can contribute in all areas of the game. is a franchise-level, big, strong, and smart top-line with a complete game who should pay quick dividends. often injured in recent years, whoever drafts him will do their due diligence and cross fingers hoping past injuries don't impact future performance. is a top-line that plays both ends of the ice. he processes the game so quickly that there is rarely hesitation in his play. he is always moving his feet and gains momentum because of his ability to accelerate quickly; starting and stopping on the puck. his stride length is excellent and he shows great hustle. he has the ability to quickly change direction and move laterally to cut off and get ahead of opponents. his skillset is so wellrounded and he is so hungry to achieve success that it can be difficult for an opponent to defend him at this level. his passing game is solid, hitting teammates for clean passes with just the amount of mustard. he is an unselfish player who draws so much attention to himself that it allows more space for his teammates to get to open spots. he shoots the puck without hesitation, and is able to unload quickly with both velocity and accuracy. he has good timing on his shots and can really queue up a dangerous one-timer. he can overwhelm his opponents by being heavy on the puck and showing off effective puckhandling and puck protection skills. he isn't all flash and dash but a lot of the highly-skilled plays he makes go without much credit. his quickness and skill make him one of the most disruptive players on the ice - he is capable of magically stealing pucks and making a play before opponents know the puck is off their blade. his reach, hand eye coordination and positioning, including his ability to break up plays defensively, make no puck in his general vicinity safe. he shows high iq with his decision-making skills on and off the puck. he is hard on the body and plays with healthy aggression. he has a physical edge to him and can rock opponents with a timely hit. will stand up for himself when challenged, fighting and feeding some solid punches to opponents who think they can intimidate him. he competes hard; displayed by his willingness to engage on second and third efforts to disrupt plays, trying to make an impact all over the ice. we all know he can play and has the prerequisite skills to contribute at the next level but for a guy who had difficulty staying out of sick bay since suffering a sports hernia during the 2015-16 playoffs, there are some injury concerns that will need to be alleviated by medical professionals. there have also been some rumblings about an all-aboutme type of attitude creeping in this season and perceived lackadaisical play in some games, but in our opinion those concerns are overblown.\n",

            " is one of the best defense prospects of the modern era as a first-year draft eligible player. he looks special on the ice, whether it was logging top-four minutes in the hockey league, being a power play man for national team or being the top defenseman at the world juniors, all at the age of 17. his skill and iq rank among the very best in the class. he can play at such a quick pace and make highly creative plays versus pros which at his age is unusual. what stands out to me is not his elite skill but his elite awareness. he understands how to attack defenses so well and attempts things i don't see players his age try. he sees gaps in coverage before they develop, makes great feeds, knows how to angle guys out and when to go for a risky play. he also has a low panic threshold and doesn't tend to force plays. he's a very good skater who, while not exceptionally fast, has good speed and is very agile for a player his size. his decisions aren't perfect at the highest of levels, but given his age and position, one can afford to give him a few mulligans. his offense is what will get him picked at the top of the class, but he is quite good defensively, as he battles hard, is physical and plays a quiet position game. while defense projections are riskier than forwards, he has the potential to be a franchise defenseman. a couple of weeks ago, i broke down what makes so unique. the truth is, what sets him apart is the unknown. combination of lateral quickness, ability as a goal-scoring threat and skating create a player who is dynamic enough to potentially become the league's best offensive defenceman. in a league where true no. 1 defencemen are at more of a premium than they've perhaps ever been, has that kind of raw upside — and then some. in a country that has produced a good percentage of the nhl's best defenders, has shattered records. he is one of the most gifted defencemen to enter the draft in decades and a transformational talent that could make him a perennial norris trophy contender. there isn't a lot to say about at this point. for the past two years, he has seemingly had a lock on the no. 1 spot and just continues getting better. the buffalo sabres won't need to overthink things at no. 1, since is the cornerstone defenseman the team desperately needs. there are plenty of other needs, and viewing as a savior is probably not the best idea at this point -- especially after jack eichel came in with similar hype -- but there's no doubt buffalo will be instantly better the second he throws the blue jersey over his head. is viewed in similar context as connor mcdavid and auston matthews as a generational talent, particularly on the blue line. i've been saying he's the best defensive prospect in a decade, but some scouts think it's even longer than that. to be that young and play a top-four role, averaging more than 19 minutes per game on one of the top teams in the hockey league, is pretty rare. additionally, established an record for points by an under-18 player at any position with 20 in 42 games. in terms of hockey sense, skating and puck-handling abilities, grades out as an exceptional player. his one weakness might be his shot, and he absolutely could get tougher in the defensive zone, which he readily admits is something he needs to continue to work on. that said, he already does a lot at an nhl level at just 17 years old. we haven't seen a draft-eligible defender with this level of upside since drew doughty. ceiling is even higher. effortless skating mixed with size, smarts, and dangles that would make pavel datsyuk nod in approval. he's the entire package and has all the tools to become a game-changing pillar for an organization. buffalo is rightly excited. is a smart two-way defenseman who can play in any situation. he is a terrific skater and stick handler who can rush the puck, or join the attack in a hurry. impressive agility makes him a good one-on-one defender. he has fine passing ability, and although not a big-time bomber, he has an accurate shot from the point. not one to shy away from the physical game, is an accomplished open-ice hitter. a young player, he must learn when to make the simpler play. adding more weight should help him in board battles and around the crease. a dominant rearguard, he's got powerful strides. he's shown that he can move around very smoothly in all directions, which allows him to buy time at the blue line. he's able to move laterally, escaping the puck-chasers and opening up passing lanes. an always noticeable player, he brings an incredible presence to both ends of the rink. he has tremendous vision, an outstanding understanding of the game. he can supply an extremely offensive game. he joins rushes whenever he can and he can carry the puck up ice with great speed and immense confidence. with his pace, he is able to shed opponents in the neutral zone with just two or three strides. if he opts to pass instead of rush, he's capable of unleashing long and accurate outlet passes. it's like he sees lanes before he even gets possession of the puck. whenever he's on the ice, his team is likely to receive an odd-man-rush opportunity. he never appears to be under pressure and he makes the decision, thanks to his heads-up approach. physically, he plays really solidly, closing gaps with sound physical play and winning lots of board battles. no opponent sneaks by him. his defensive game, overall, and his positioning are greatly improved. occasionally, he'll jump out of position to pursue a possible attack, but he's very reliable. impossible to beat one-on-one\n",

            " when you think of what teams are looking for in a no. 1 it looks a lot like . he's a right-shot centerman who measures in around 6-foot-4, with a lot of skill and offensive iq, and plays heavy minutes. he makes high-end plays to his teammates and through defenders with consistency. his vision particularly stands out. he has great patience, finds guys in traffic and makes tough passes when you least expect it. he's a prototypical power play qb and plays a 5-foot-10 skill game in a big man's body. showed that he can play all situations. he's not the most physical big man, but he's reliable defensively and often played more than 20 minutes a night for saskatoon in tough matchups. at the hlinka gretzky cup, he showed he could be a net-front guy on the power play. has good speed. his feet don't match his skill and his first step could be a bit better, but overall he's the total package and a player who projects to be a front-line in the nhl. his consistency is the only issue i have. with his toolkit, he should have dominated the but he only did that in stretches with a midseason lull, though he ended his season strong. saskatoon blades coach mitch love on : “he's a student of the game. he's got a very high hockey iq. his playmaking ability is second to none. there aren't many 6-foot-4, 200 pound, 17-year-old players who can play the way he can.” a 6-foot-4 playmaking centre whose stride isn't awkward and heavy? gasp. there are good odds goes higher than his ranking here (as high as the top five) on the basis of those tools — and it would be hard to blame the team that takes him. he's huge, he's strong on the puck, he handles it well in tight (rare for a player his size), he's a better skater than he gets credit and his length makes him a lot to handle when he drives the net (which he needs to do more often) or controls the puck on the cycle. he's also a player coaches lean on defensively because he uses his stick effectively to disrupt plays and win battles. has also begun to play more physically and use his frame more effectively along the wall, which was one of the things i'd have liked to see more of last season. my biggest concern with his game is one of upside. going to be an nhl centre. a good one. but his growth hasn't been pronounced enough for me to be confident that he has the dynamic ability needed to be a 1c at the next level. it's easy to imagine him as a productive 2c, though, and given all of the other elements he offers, that makes him an extremely valuable prospect nonetheless. the blades are going to lose standout overagers dawson davidson and max gerlach next season and the team will be handed over to , so i'm intrigued to see just how dominant he can become in that role. has size, smarts and skill. it's not often that you get a play-driving at 6-foot-4 who makes the game look as easy as does. although he lacks explosiveness, he skates smoothly and has a great sense of how to get to where he needs to be efficiently. size and body positioning are two ways he can mitigate some of the concerns about footwork and lack of separation speed. when he does have the puck, is a shot-pass threat who can score goals in a variety of ways. he's especially successful at driving the net. while he has that size and solid middle drive, can also pick teams apart from the outside, thanks to high-end vision and elite distribution skills. he has dealt with bouts of inconsistency that caused some concern and a general dip in projections, and he didn't necessarily dominate the on a regular basis. but when he was on, he was unstoppable. it's something to take into account, but i still place a high value on best being so much better than that of a large swath of the top players in this class. when is at his best, he's one of the most offensively gifted players in this class. his vision is elite, and his creativity is up there, too. has the rare ability to create scoring chances and goals seemingly at will, and good luck to the poor defenceman that tries to stop his 6-foot-4 frame. this poor sap had to find out the hard way that it's a near-impossible task. power moves like the one posted above increasingly became a facet of game as the season continued. it's clear that he's beginning to understand the physical advantages available to him, and leveraging those for grade-a scoring chances. it's added a fastball to arsenal, whereas he used to only operate with breaking pitches. in layman's, foremost skill is as a playmaker. this three-zone pass is a perfect example of how well sees the ice, and how that vision allows him to make quick decisions once the puck is on his stick to take advantage of the defence. the downside with is that his production, although good, isn't spectacular, and that's what was required to rank any higher with players like cozens and turcotte directly in front of him. furthermore, it's slightly concerning (sample size limitations here are worth accounting for) that is only completing about two-thirds of his passes based on the sample of games i've tracked — a low number compared to his peers — and his scoring chance assist numbers aren't great either. is the prototypical first-line centre that teams dream of landing at the draft. well, at least in theory. stands at 6-foot-4, has silky-smooth mitts and can power through defencemen with pace when he's at the top of his game. over the year, i found that wielded his lengthy-frame to greater effect with each passing game. i'm not ready to label him a power forward — is more of a playmaker — but the capability to bury the shoulder, drive to the net, and find twine with two or three defenders dangling off of him is there. it's interesting to note, though, that in the five-game sample i tracked for that he did a better job of generating scoring chances himself than setting up his teammates. the concerns i have about game stem mostly from wavering competitiveness on a game-to-game basis, as well as his penchant for absorbing dangerous, massive hits as a result of skating with his head down — seriously, it's a legitimate concern for his long-term durability. i see the potential for to develop into a dynamic no. 1 centre, but in my estimation, he's more likely destined to play as a no. 2 pivot. due to his size and ability, is often compared to fellow dylan cozens. however, there are differences in their game. is more of a playmaker than a goal scorer. he uses his frame and high-end puck skills to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. biggest knock is his game often lacks tenacity and a high level of compete. projects as a high-end #2 at the nhl level and is likely a year or two away from regular nhl duty. a tantalizing combination of skill and size, is an offense-first who is developing his 200-foot game. he may not always look crisp when striding quickly, but he's an absolute wrecking ball and showcases a ton of power in his feet. his stride will need to be refined which will lead to more neutral zone speed. simply put, he's a highlight reel waiting to happen. he plays with a calm confidence, dictates the pace of play and has the ability to take over a game at any point. displaying incredible vision and passing ability, he works well in tight around the net with very soft hands. he is sublime in his puck control both in tight and with his hands away from his body. he plays with a very long stick and is a vacuum for any puck within his reach. once he has possession, he is incredibly difficult to strip of the puck due to his size, reach and impeccable puck control. defensively, is solid. he uses his lengthy stick very well, but could use his huge frame to separate opponents off the puck more often. overall, has high-end skill with above average hockey iq. he needs to compete harder at winning more battles and loose pucks. although he has shown moderate improvements on the dot, more work on winning faceoffs will be necessary.\n",

            " has some physical assets that pop off the page from a pro projection. he's a nhl-caliber skater who can transition pucks up ice very well with his speed. he has average size, but he's quite strong and physical. with his mobility he's able to close on checks well, and often uses his body to land hard hits to separate pucks from players. he has good individual skill, with the hands to beat checks one-on-one and generate a lot of power off his one-timer. isn't a gifted puck-mover though and can struggle at times with his puck distribution. he projects as a full-time second- or third pair defenseman depending on how much the offense translates to higher levels. , one of the more universally well-liked prospects in this draft among nhl folks, has been a top prospect in this age group for years and has developed into a well-rounded, hard-shooting two-way defender. after a slow start to his year, he really came on late and played his best hockey when all eyes were on him down the stretch into u18 worlds. i like him in neutral ice on both sides of the puck. he's got a great stick. he can really rip it when he takes the five-to-eight feet available off of the line and looks for his own shot. balanced skating mechanics, good posture, and an ability and willingness to defend with the body and stick help him defend at a very high level man-to-man. and while his production doesn't leap off the page at you, that's largely because hutson and casey were the go-to power-play defencemen at the he looks and plays a lot like a pro already and was counted upon to play alongside hutson on team top pairing in the (a trust that was also reflected in the ‘a' on his jersey). his game lacks the creativity of hutson and casey, but i've learned not to confuse his “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” game for being ordinary. he's extremely effective and there's still some aggressiveness and skill to his package, even if it's more predictable. and lane hutson are an interesting dynamic. hutson is very creative and mobile. he has good body language and can shift his body to a new lane on a dime. isn't as nimble and mobile. that just isn't his game. does have the same drive to create high and medium danger chances in the slot, but he is more likely to pinch up the boards with the puck than go into open ice and battle it out against attackers at the perimeter. the good thing is that seems to have the support of the coaching staff to let him play his game. knows that he has to be somewhat conservative given that hutson can be far more out-going in the offensive zone. i do think will will be a solid two-way defender in the nhl level. if he can be slightly more consistent with his drive to create high danger chances, he could be provide nice defensive depth in a second or third pairing role. will also need to address his acceleration / skating as oppositional speed will only get more and more daunting at the nhl level. his offensive numbers won't jump out at you, but might be one of the most well-rounded defenders in this entire draft. he is an excellent skater with tremendous defensive sense highlighted by his gap control and ability to defend the rush. he retrieves pucks especially well and can aid his team's transition with his feet or with a good first pass. has a good shot, too, but we didn't get to see it as much this year. he takes what is given to him offensively, doesn't try to force things and he just always seems to make the play in his own zone. his hockey sense is some of the best among defensemen in this draft and i would not be surprised to see him go a bit higher. if he had better offensive numbers this year and could more consistently prove that offensive prowess is there, i would have likely considered more seriously for the top 15 of this class. i'm just not sure if the skill is good enough for him to get there. if he does, though, we might look back at as the best defenseman in this class. the steady presence on the top pairing all season, can also show off some offensive skills. he likely plays a new-age shutdown role at the next level but can skate and move the puck well enough to play up the lineup. the righty likely goes earlier than this spot. there was a serious disconnect between output this season and the tools at his disposal. every item in his toolkit earned an average-to-above-average grade from our staff, but the sum was often less than the whole of its parts. it was easy enough for us to identify where the disconnect occurred. when took the initiative with the puck and tried to make things happen, the game looked easy. when he wasn't playing with pace, not so much. in no phase of the game was this more apparent than on the breakout. four-way mobility and handling skill allowed him to manoeuvre past forecheckers with relative ease, but finding passing options further up-ice and getting them the puck in a timely fashion often eluded him. the result was lost opportunities to cue quick breaks and counter plays at best and costly turnovers at worst. it's much the same story in the offensive zone, where inability to register options and get them the puck in a timely fashion limits his effectiveness as a playmaker. \"despite having the tools to make high-end offensive plays, however, rarely takes charge of the game,\" elite prospects lead scout wrote in a scout's notebook article on ep rinkside. \"he fades into the background. the defenceman [had] just 15 points in 41 games over the season, a low total for such a highly-touted player coming into the season.\" some of these processing issues should improve with minor tweaks to his game; simple stuff like scanning for options going into retrievals and off-puck will go a long way. we also anticipate that a more predictable system that doesn't rely as much on the stretch pass as the will help keep him on schedule. so, there's hope yet. to his credit, finished the season on a strong note, playing his best hockey of the year in germany at the u18s on the top-pair alongside lane hutson. \"if i had room for a third defenceman on my u18 all-star ballot, i'd have a hard time thinking of a more deserving candidate than ,\" ep rinkside editor-in-chief j.d. burke wrote of his work at the tournament. \"our scouting team has always admired tools -- the skating, the stout physical build, and the passing skill -- but concerns about his ability to process the game with pace have kept him from the first round of our board. we may have to change that, because was one of the tournament's most efficient puck-movers, regularly identifying the best option and getting them the puck without a moment's delay.\" short of any growth as a puck-mover, still has a durable defensive foundation on which he can build an nhl career. his skating form allows him to play a tight gap through the neutral zone and close on attackers before they even get to the blue line. he's at his best as an in-zone defender, though, where his defensive radius and physicality make him a legitimate play-stopper. some team is going to bet on immense physical gifts in the hopes that time with an nhl staff can bring out the best in the commit. they'll probably do so with a pick in the teens at that. it's not an unreasonable play, either. if things break you're looking at a right-shot, top-four defenceman with utility in both phases in special teams. the league places a premium on those sorts of players. a solid two-way defender can play in some situations. offensive ceiling is a question at the next level. is a strong, two-way defender who does tend to place more emphasis on the defensive side of the game. with his strong skating and positional discipline, he is a strong rush defender and more than adequate when the opposition has a longer stay in his end. he uses his footwork and his stick positioning to force puck-carriers away from the lane to negate potential high-danger chances off the rush. offensively, he does have the ability to drive transitional play. he's a strong skater with good vision and a knack for making a crisp and accurate first pass. his offensive production doesn't jump off the page at all, which may lower some people's opinion of him, especially with the way the game is evolving but just because his production isn't impressive doesn't mean his ability to play the offensive game is lacking. there may be some hidden offensive creativity however, after he played the de facto stay-at-home role when routinely paired with the offensive lane hutson, who loved to push the envelope offensively. his biggest issue is his ceiling. he's not all that flashy and won't wow anyone with an abundance of highly skilled plays, but what he will do is play quality minutes and rarely put his team behind the eight-ball whenever he is out there. he flashed a bit of his offensive potential at the under-18s and showed what he can do when he decides to take the reins off himself. if he can be the player he was at that late-season tournament more consistently, then there'd be more belief he has a much higher ceiling at the nhl level. isn't the flashiest of prospects, but is the type of player who will carve out a long and quality career because of the reliable presence he brings when he's on the ice.\n",

            " got a regular shift and power play time in the this past season for djurgarden, as one of the most productive u18 players that league has seen. has been on the prospect radar a long time. he has a lot of exciting dimensions to his game, but his goal-scoring ability stands out. he has a truly elite shot. he can pick corners from any spot in the offensive zone, with a very hard and accurate wrist shot. his hands are elite, which allows him to beat defenders clean with his 1-on-1 moves and pull off the occasional highlight reel play. while he is known for his goal-scoring, is also a very good passer. he won't be a top playmaker in the nhl, but he can find the seams and has the high offensive iq to let plays develop and find his teammates. his skating is somewhere between average to above-average for me, but i did find his game lacked pace when i watched this season. off the puck he's fine; he competes well enough but he's not an overly physical player and can be a bit of a perimeter player due to how much he leans on his shot. i have to be honest: in recent months, as i finalized this list, i debated swapping and raymond. at one point during this process, was no. 4 and raymond was no. 5. there's a lot about game i believe remains a tad disrespected. everyone agrees he has power to his game and that he's got arguably the best wrist shot in the draft (his one-timer still needs some work). but some question his small area skill or his quickness or his playmaking talent. and while he needs to continue to develop his touch in traffic and his first few steps, i would argue the third point is a lot better than he usually gets credit for. does he need to tunnel vision a little less when he has the puck? sometimes. but i've seen him feather backhand passes through unsuspecting seams or feign shot before hitting the backdoor guy with a hard pass across the crease or use the attention his shot gets to hit the trailer off the rush. that will give his game more dimension than people realize, i suspect. he has already shown he can make an impact at the pro level more than most others near the top of this draft, too. i was particularly impressed with the way he handled being asked to play a new role on the power play (after spending his entire junior career on the flank, djurgardens moved him to the slot). find success from all over the offensive zone. while a plethora of his goals come from the slot, he has managed to score plenty of goals from just outside the faceoff dots. not only does embody strong shooting range, but he can pick corners with precision. can find the smallest gaps and still succeed. the only area in the offensive zone, in which should look to improve is his forechecking. the other area in play that needs to be addressed is his puck control. last but not least, let's touch on his skating. is not the fastest skater on the ice, but he does have a wide stride and will more than likely improve his speed over time. there's a lot to like about , not the least of which is that his game continues to grow. after tacking on muscle last year, he handled the pro grind pretty well in was a major factor for the world junior team that won bronze, and he showed a bit more commitment to two-way play. he is a natural offensive talent, with an elite release and quick hands. he has vision and offensive sense that challenge opposing defenses, along with the strength to drive the net. his skating is very good, and there's power in his stride. markus naslund and peter forsberg. those are the only two u18 skaters in history to produce goals at a better rate than last season. we always knew could score; he has the best shot in this draft. it's his everywhere else that solidified his hold on the sixth overall spot. djurgardens winger is the best finisher in this year's draft, and it's not especially close. that was the case going into the season, and he's done his part to hold the throne as we close the book on the 2020 nhl draft. the list of u18 skaters to score more goals than in the is two players long. was one goal off the record set by markus naslund in 1991. no surprise there. set the record for goals in the j20 superelit as a draft-minus-one skater with 30 tallies in 38 contests just one year prior. he'd mercifully moved on to the men's squad this season, but that didn't stop him from scoring over two goals a game through three games of spot duty. his shot is as good as it gets, and it makes him a threat to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. he'i i avai i himself of any opportunity to shoot the puck too, as evidenced by the relatively even distribution of attempts plotted by lnstat in this handy shot chart. what's more, can let it rip without breaking his stride, a feather in his cap that makes him a unique threat off of the rush. it's just the sort of tool one could reliably build their career around. that seemed to be the plan for going into this season too. it'd worked for him up to that point, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? the best players are never satisfied, and rapacious appetite for improvement informed tremendous growth in every other facet of his game over the course of this season. simply put: might be the player who most developed from the start of the year to its conclusion. \"this kid is so, so driven,\" one scout told eliteprospects this season. \"he's always in the weight room, always putting in extra time after practice, always putting in the work.\" that's one voice in a chorus of endorsements leaguewide for the player perhaps most admired by the scouting community for their character off of the ice. it's plain to see on the ice, too. where an unengaged once floated between the blue lines, he's now backtracking with enthusiasm. where a passive once floated towards loose pucks in offensive zone retrievals, he now engages physically and often pins his opponents to the boards in support. he's never going to win a frank j. selke trophy for his defensive work at the next level. his odds are in the same ballpark as the rest of us at eliteprospects. but if can maintain average or slightly above average defensive metrics at the nhl level, then it's going to make him a much more valuable, reliable player. similarly, is never going to lead the league in assists. he's trigger-happy to a fault, and that often comes at the expense of his linemates' opportunities to score in prime positions. even when finds himself in an obvious passing situation, his vision often fails him. for to reach his ceiling, he'll need to add muscle, refine his defensive reads, and just continue along the course he chartered this season. isn't that just par for the course though? is a pure sniper as currently constructed, and he has the potential to be a first-line finisher with triggerman utility on the power play. he's a special, special talent, and if he can refine that talent then there's no telling where it might take him. similar to raymond, i had in my top five to begin the year and i had pretty high expectations of him heading into the season. similar to raymond, has struggled at times in the men's league, though he has managed to put up 9 goals. he did have an excellent world junior championship also, posting 3 goals as an under-ager. is a nature goal-scorer and has one of the best shots in the draft. he finds ways to get open in traffic to create scoring opportunities. looks like a one-dimensional type player, but his goal-scoring upside is high. he looks like a top-six winger who may need another year or so of a pure goal scorer and elite offensive threat, he is a dynamic forward who is an agile skater when he keeps his legs moving. while he needs to work on his acceleration and speed, he makes up for it with his dangerous shot and goal scoring abilities – and he isn't afraid to shoot the puck often. highly skilled when it comes to creating space for himself and his teammates in the offensive zone and ability to keep control of the puck. he sees the ice very well and uses his hockey iq to find open teammates with accurate passes. has a keen nose for the net and causes a lot of issues for opponents with his flair for making plays. he has built on his frame this summer and looks strong in puck battles, using his frame to protect the puck. defensively, he keeps his head on a swivel and keeps an eye on his man while also watching the play and staying in position. whether he is blocking a shot or breaking up a pass, he is invested in his own end. one bad habit he will need to break is the temptation to cheat on the breakout, leaving his teammates behind. he is a player that can make a huge impact in the nhl if paired with a playmaker and will surely score a lot of goals at the next level. seems to learn from his mistakes and will be relied upon for power plays and special teams in the future.\n",

            " calling a goal scorer isn't a novel observation given his stats this season but he's shown he can score goals in a variety of ways. he has great hands and can create offense through his skill. he generates a lot of offense around the high-percentage areas because of his strength and compete. also has a shot that can score from range. he's smart enough with the puck to move it well but is more of a shooter and worker than a playmaker. his skating is ok. i've heard from scouts who like it but i've never seen a player who can separate with speed. he projects as a top-nine winger. put together one of the most productive age-adjusted seasons in the history of top junior level and two strong performances internationally for (first at last year's hlinka gretzky cup, and then more recently at u18 worlds, where he was also the team's captain) in his draft year. he's a bigger, stronger player than his two contemporaries in djurgården and while he doesn't have lekkerimaki's dynamism or ostlund's breeziness, that doesn't make him any less interesting as the shot-and-pass, power-and-finesse combination player that he is. i love the way he shades into and away from pressure in control. his shot comes off his blade quick, hard and naturally, rocking it back into his stance and letting it go (it really pops). his offensive arsenal is multi-faceted and he's got some really sneaky craftiness and evasiveness to his game to complement the tools of strength over the puck/through his shot that are obvious. he'll need to pick up a step to translate his game to the pro level, but i wouldn't call his skating an impediment (it's better than he usually get credit for) and he's always finding ways to get to pucks and/or get open around the home plate area inside the offensive zone, where his skill and shot take over. plays an excellent two-way game that is translatable at the nhl level. with his speed and skill, i don't think there will be a long wait before he is playing at the nhl level. he probably needs at least one season in the allsvenskan before he is ready to make the jump. in terms of projection, tool-kit will allow him to be impactful no matter what line he is on. he is a swiss army knife. you can plug him on the top lines and use him to hunt pucks down low on the forecheck. he will get those pucks and wire passes to the slot to drive production. in certain situations, you could plug him in a third line checking role, but i do believe that will slow down his offensive production as the forwards that he is with more than likely won't be capitalizing at the same rate as the forwards on the top two lines. a strong, committed forward with a heavy, accurate shot, is a gifted two-way player who excels in the offensive zone. he's not much of a driver, which is why i think he could slip a little further in the first round, but he is an absolute finisher. the things he can do from the tops of the faceoff circles down make him stand out. has good physical strength, he competes at a good enough level to win puck battles and that shot is legit. he averaged more than a goal per game in 30 games in top u20 league. he wasn't as effective as a pro as i think he needs to be to improve his pace, but there's definitely some special offensive tools that are enhanced by the strength he possesses. is a handful to play against, too. wasn't the fastest or even the most skilled offensive player on his own team this past year, but that didn't stop him from leading them on the scoresheet and in the room. he popped above a goal-per-game in the j20, captained the swedes at the u18s and showcased his direct and mature style in 25 contests. he has the ability to be a chameleon and fill whatever role is needed up and down the lineup. underrated hands and feet with a rocket of a shot. he's smart and tenacious. this kid is a pro. all did last season was put up ridiculous point totals in nearly every setting that was fortunate enough to have him. his 58 points in 30 j20 nationell games in djurgårdens' was the fifth-highest mark in league history among first-time draft-eligible prospects, and his 1.93 points per game the new record for per-game scoring. he finished second on hlinka-gretzky bronze medal-winning roster, and fourth on their gold medal-winning u18s squad. perhaps the most impressive stat of all, though, is 33 goals in 30 regular season contests in the j20, 28 of which came at even strength; that number grows to 35 goals in 36 games if you include the postseason. the only place where failed to find the scoresheet with any regularity was in the with djurgårdens men's squad; a league where first-time draft-eligibles usually don't even play and on a team so poor that their season ended with relegation to the hockeyallsvenskan. everything happens in motion for . he gets moving as pucks arrive at his position, skates through his passes, and doesn't need to break stride to get off his shot. he plays at such a heightened pace that the puck often flies from his stick no sooner than you realize he's even secured possession in the first place. this breakneck pace was a bit of a double-edged sword for our staff. on the one hand, we came to appreciate the urgency of game and how it resulted in offensive opportunities nearly every time the puck touched his stick in the j20 circuit. on the other hand, it made getting a read on any of his non-skating tools a tad bit difficult. \"the shorter and less frequent puck touches make it harder to evaluate the range of his tools, but with the devel-opment, most of them should become above nhl average in a few years,\" elite prospects lead scout remarked in a scout's notebook article. \" can offer speed, handling skills, and even a physical presence. his strong skating posture and his knee and ankle flexion allow him to protect the puck against opponents down low and chase them on the forecheck. if they take too long to move the puck, they usually end up plastered on the boards. you can credibly count among this draft's du-al-threat scorers, but his shot is doing far more damage than his setups. the 6-foot-1 winger has a wide array of releases suited to any situation and has shown an excellent knack for changing the angle or the release point on his shot to take advantage of developing screens or windows in the defensive coverage. now, there's a bit of a catch here, and it's that didn't always play with the same level of enthusiasm in the defensive zone as he did the offensive one. his physicality and his off-puck sense are such that the basis is there for at least an adequate level of defensive play as he rises up the ranks of professional hockey, but the work rate wasn't always there in our viewings. that's going to have to change for to play a high-leverage role in the big leagues. the other concern among our staff is that the forward wasn't always much of a planner with his puck touches. it wasn't uncommon for to run out of time or space and have to circle back or turn the puck over where even a little forethought would've made all the difference. there's no such thing as a fully-formed player at the nhl entry draft, though, and will have plenty of time to round out his game en route to a productive career as a middle-six scoring winger in the nhl. the 2022 draft is a little light on high-end prospects. that being said, there are still a few options available for teams in the first round, and is at the top of my list. is a strong, prototypical forward. he is a well-rounded offensive player with a strong release and excellent offensive instincts. he also isn't a liability defensively. more of a goal-scorer, disguises his shot well and can rip it from anywhere with ease. he is physically mature and is closer to nhl-ready than many of his peers. scouts have some questions surrounding his offensive ceiling, especially considering his struggle to put up points when he did play games in top league. however, the combination of size and shot make him a strong first-round candidate with middle-six potential at the nhl level. is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. is a phenomenal offensive winger who has a variety of ways to create offense if given space in the opponent's zone. for one, he is a fantastic puck distributor. he can dish the puck to open teammates, especially below the circles on his usual power play spot. when with the puck, he can deke and dangle opponents when needed to bypass defenders. in flashes, he shows top-end skill and brilliance that indicate he is one of the highest-upside players in the draft class. while the skill with his hands and playmaking ability are his primary offensive tools, he also does impress with his shot. he can quickly change angles and manipulate his shot angle in order to release quick pucks off that can either beat goalies or create rebound opportunities. the only thing he needs to do to his offensive game: simplify. too often he will try to do too much and lose possession of the puck, causing ill-timed turnovers. with a more developed, simple, and practical game, he can become an even better offensive threat. in the defensive zone, his play takes an expected dip. his positioning could be better, often seen cheating for offense. probably most worrisome, his use of his stick is not ideal. he tries too often to pokecheck his opponents, when a less aggressive, more positional style of defense would have been more suitable in defending the rush. he should see his name called in the first round of the nhl draft, considering his multifaceted offensive game is one of the best in the draft class. with a more patient attitude in the offensive and refinement in the defensive zone, best-case should develop into a second-line scoring winger who performs well on the power play for his team.\n",

            " had a fantastic season in playing significant minutes in the country's top league and showing flashes of dominance versus men in and at the world championships. has a ton of skill in his game. he's got the high-end hands to make plays through defenders and the cute dangles that will make highlight reels. can make the real tough passes and makes a lot of great decisions, but his creativity is what impressed me most. he improvises very well, with the high offensive iq to know how to create offense versus men. has good size, and he's not afraid to lean on guys. he's not a crash and bang type, but he protects pucks very well, he takes pucks hard to the net and he already showed that he can power his way past pro defensemen as a 17-year-old. his speed is just average for me. he's not slow, but his skating is not the selling point of his game. despite average speed, he gets inside to the net so well because of how fearless and strong he is. could be an impact forward in the nhl, whether at the wing and possibly even at and should transition quickly into that role. tps manager antero niittymaki on : “his stick handling and overall skill level is one of the best i've ever seen at his age. we put him on the top line early in the year, and even though he was this young, skinny guy, you could see away he's strong with the puck in the corners. he's really balanced on his skates. it's tough to knock him off the puck. since the world juniors, he was dominant in regards to (his physical play). he can hang onto the puck as long as he wants. he's nhl ready.” while hughes was playing at under-18 worlds, was playing friendlies and practicing with national team ahead of the senior world championships after an excellent five-game, four-goal performance in playoffs. in the final three of those games that i tracked, he averaged 22:36 time on ice and attempted 17 shots. is that rare blend of power and creativity. he can use his strong, extended stride to build momentum and drop his shoulder to drive the net but he can also feign the net-drive play only to make a deft pass to a teammate. is also lethal from the right-wing circle (where tps used him on the power play) and gets low to leverage his one-timer and extend through pucks, which gives him a different kind of game-breaking talent than hughes, even when he's not playing well. both of his final two goals of the playoffs came from that spot. here's that one-knee one-timer i was talking about. and here's his standstill shot, which can also beat goalies cleanly, as well as a flash of his stick handling ability (and some impressive footwork) to evade the pressure. needs to correct the pitch-fork he has developed in his straightaway stride but he has all of the tools needed to be one of hockey's dominant wingers. your eyes did not deceive you at the world championship. already plays at a high level with and against pro-level players. after he recorded the third-best scoring season by a u18 player in history, it was not a shock that he posted six goals and an assist for gold-medalist only patrik laine had more points at a world championship as a u18 player. there's so much to love about game. he has a great frame and uses it well, as he's hard to take off the puck and uses that ability to create extra time for himself to find plays. he has the vision to spot those plays and make them quickly, and i think his hand skills have gotten to a fringe elite level. his shot is high-end and heavy; he can beat goalies from distance, but then he also has the skill to make plays in tight at the net front. although not hughes-like in his skating, he is powerful and has enough speed to break away from the opposition. his edgework is strong, and his balance makes him so difficult to play against. he has power, but he does need more explosiveness in his skating. battles as well as any player, both in puck pursuit and with it on his stick. there's a definite fire in him to compete, and he will be a cornerstone nhl winger. only mikael granlund and aleksandr barkov have produced more offence on per game basis than in the men's league, is a dynamic player with the puck on his stick, capable of dropping his shoulder and driving to the net or methodically cutting through defenders one move at a time, avoiding contact entirely. it's that creativity that makes such a unique offensive threat. the goals-heavy point split and skill-set lend themselves to the belief that he's a goal-scorer first and foremost. one of the surprising developments of game this season has been his ability to create offence through his linemates. loves to set up shop below the goal line, and from there he does a fantastic job of warding off defenders and finding teammates for grade-a scoring chances. in fact, in the sample of players i've tracked, has among the highest scoring chance assist numbers and is completing 80 percent of his passes — for context, hughes is completing 85 percent of his. plays like these have helped form the notion that could, potentially, be a centre at the nhl level. i'm not sure that i'm quite convinced yet. i'd need to see perform at a high-level down the middle for an extended sample to believe it. then again, i'd hate to bet against the guy either. is the leading point producer in his class by theseal (situational era age league) adjusted scoring rating, also developed by davis on canucksarmy. he might not possess the ceiling that hughes does, but i anticipate that transition to the nhl will be a smoother one in the short-term. the list of skaters to produce as much or more than did last season in the as a first-time draft-eligible skater is two players long: mikael granlund and aleksander barkov. using seal adjustments on scoring rates him as the most productive player in this year's draft, with 2.05 adjusted points per game. there isn't a better player in this year's class from below the hashmarks than . i'm not sure that there are going to be many in the nhl either. what lacks in straight line acceleration and two-step quickness he more than makes up for his with balance and agility on his edges. he's near-impossible to push off of the puck, and that comes in handy when one spends as much time in tight to the opponent's net as does. he's adaptable with the puck, threading the needle through traffic to feed his teammates grade-a scoring chances or driving to the net-front himself. as far as consolation prizes go, one can't hope for much more than at second overall. he's going to be a capable middle-six winger in the nhl from day one, with the potential to become an elite, play-driving, first line winger in the years that follow. i also suspect that he'll have an easier time transitioning to the nhl than hughes, at least in the short-term, for whatever that's worth. was a revolution this season. he was ranked by many to be a top 10 pick before the beginning of the year, and he had solidified his number 2 ranking by christmas. is a powerful goal-scorer. in fact, he broke florida star alex barkov's record for most goals by an under-18 player in top league. also tore up the world championships, scoring another 5 goals against a high level of competition. is also a relentless forechecker and is almost impossible to knock off the puck. only knock at times is his speed, but he makes up for his lack of top speed with elite hockey sense. he projects as a franchise winger. look for to be in the nhl as soon as next season and make an immediate impact. a deceptive presence who's really slippery for a player of his build, doesn't have any major flaws to his game. his speed is an underrated feature, considering it's his hands and overall goal-scoring abilities that most scouts rave about. a very noticeable player every time he hits the ice, he skates very well and shows flashes of up-tempo speed. his top speed has improved a lot and his mobility is great for guy his size. he does a good job of shifting his body to change attack angles and although he sometimes shows some naive tendencies to overhandle the puck, he has the ability to put an accurate touch on his passes. displaying spectacular puck skills, he's strong in the corners and has shown that he's a beast physically. his ability to do lots of small things with the puck is a tremendous asset. he can take hits and keep his balance, which is why he wins a lot of puck battles. he likes to use his size to his advantage and he's tremendous when protecting the puck. he needs to improve his overall consistency to be a difference maker shift to shift and fill out a bit to play a heavier game. having put in a lot of work in on his game over the past year, he's more than ready to take his game to the next level.\n",

            " started off very well, as a rare first-year draft-eligible to not only play but also excel in the he fell off in the second half, but his body of work between junior, pro and international is quite strong. athletic toolkit doesn't jump out at you immediately. he's about 6-foot-3 and moves well but not at an elite level. what makes him such a good goaltender is his tremendous sense and puck-tracking ability. he makes the read at a remarkably high frequency, with little unnecessary movement in net. can make a tough save when he needs to and has some lateral quickness, but it often seems like he doesn't have to adjust his technique much on a given save, especially when the puck is in the high-percentage areas. in a sentence, projects as a quality nhl starting goaltender. finally showed signs that he was human late in the season, surrendering 13 goals on the 70 shots he faced across his final four appearances of the year (a .814 save percentage). before that, though, he had only ever looked like a manufactured goaltending robot, the kind who checked every single box. i had nitpicks about recent first-round goalies spencer knight and yaroslav askarov that i just don't really have about . the only areas where his game doesn't get an a grade is probably in his lateral explosiveness and agility on his feet (which are the strengths of askarov's game, as well as marc-andre fleury's and jonathan quick's). there's power in his pushes and he's quick enough on his feet (he's certainly not slow) but game is built on the foundations of most other nhl goalies today: he fills the net, he plays sharp angles, he swallows his rebounds, his movement is compact, and he reads a shooter and his options so well that he rarely has to scramble. so, what allows to have such great success at such a tender age? how is it that when most talented goalies his age are giving inconsistent performances at a junior level is shutting down men in one of the worlds best leagues? first and foremost – somewhat appropriately considering he lives just 90 miles south of the arctic circle – the stockholm born prospect is so cool as to appear ice cold between the posts. it does not seem that anything can ruffle his feathers. a crowded crease, one-on-ones, a barrage of shots, or quiet periods. no matter what is happening in front of him is locked in. his poise is exceptional. alongside his mental fortitude, the swede possesses a technical game that most nhl starters would be jealous of. he rarely needs to make big saves, or rely on athleticism, because his skating ability and anticipation leave him in the perfect position to deal with shots simply the majority of the time. as with most modern goalies his base set is reverse-vh when players get in close on his peripheries, and he is a master at the age of 18. unlike a lot of goalies who use it habitually, virtually never “jumps the gun” in terms of when to drop into it. so only exposes his upper corner when the angle of shot is extremely acute. part of that also might be due to how big he manages to make himself when covering his posts. is no vasilevskiy or bishop size-wise, but he uses every inch of his 6'3 frame exceptionally well. he looks bigger than he is between the pipes as a result. his ability to get himself into position no matter what the situation means that he deals with incoming pucks from all angles well, not just in terms of making the initial save, but also ensuring no rebounds. smaht scouting's josh tessler has been tracking the nhl 2021 draft eligible goalies, and from a statistical perspective has allowed less rebounds that virtually every other goalie who will be eligible in 2021. when you account for the fact that is playing against men and the others against players their own age that is even more impressive. the young swede just gobbles up shots, and has an amazing ability to get shots in awkward areas down on ice in-front of him, or trapped in his equipment. on top of his mental game and technical prowess, also has one of the best gloves you will see for a young goalie. often, this aspect of a net-minders game can take the longest time to develop. so many goalie prospects have issues, especially in the low glove area, where not being set can leave a gap that is hard to cover. but with technically ability, alongside fantastic hand-eye coordination, he plucks the puck out of the air with ease, even on shots that are hard and accurate. his glove-work through traffic is also a joy to behold as he tracks the puck and shuts play down inside his bauer trapper. as for his puck-handling? in a day and age where – partially due to the trapezoid – many goalies struggle with the puck on their stick is an exception. he grew up playing both goalie and skater, and his puck-handling makes you think he could have been a success had he never decided to don the mask. impervious to pressure with the puck on his stick behind the net, can deceive forwards and is comfortable passing both forehand and backhand. at times he acts as effectively a third defenseman, and it is not a rare site seeing him head out of net to claim loose pucks in-front of him and dish out pin-point passes. effecting a clean break-out i something he has in his arsenal that most goalies don't. so what are the issues? what needs work? well, not much. that is exactly why he might go top ten in the draft. from a technical standpoint he can sometimes over-angle his blocker, which means pucks end up closer to him that they should be, but this is a minor issue and one that would not even be raised with most goalies. the only major question? his athleticism. simply put, is not askarov or knight in that area. he is not “as” quick up and down or side-to-side as many high-end goalie talents, though he compensates for this heavily with his skating and lower-body strength, especially going laterally where he can push off the post. sure, he “can” make some amazing saves, but he cannot recover as well as some goalies. this year's no. 1-ranked goalie prospect might be special enough to merit selection as a top-five pick overall. a cool and collected presence, he's big, athletic, and perpetually well-positioned. gifted with an incredibly high hockey iq, ability to read the action out front offers a valuable edge against even the most dangerous scoring skaters. the recent season spent in the top pro league -- where he managed well, especially early on -- will only help to accelerate his inevitable march to an nhl crease. there probably isn't that much space between this year and yaroslav askarov last season. certainly, a cursory glance at numbers holding down a platoon role for luleå in the makes the comparison seem reasonable enough. may not have elite nhl goaltender upside, but our scouts see someone almost destined for a career as, at the very least, an above-average starter. the only reason that hype hasn't ascended to the same rariﬁed air as yaroslav askarov and spencer knight in seasons past is that he's entering the draft in a year shrouded in unknowns. in some respects, was one of the fortunate ones. playing with luleå in the for the balance of the year offered him a shot at regular game action, and he even cracked the roster at the world juniors. he made the most of those opportunities. took the starting job in luleå and featured in a platoon role with hugo alnefelt for u20 roster. those performances showed that is just a little bit more mature than most 18-year-old goaltenders. they also helped display his readiness for north professional hockey sooner than later. coaches and scouts alike rave over technique. it looked sharp early in his career and has only continued to improve as he climbed from the junior circuit to its top professional men's league. he's a strong, ﬂuid skater in the crease, and doesn't mind coming out to challenge oncoming threats. he'll ramp up the aggression when necessary, but only when the moment calls for it. he tracks pucks well. he doesn't get rattled when he makes a mistake. he's even shown the ability to shake some of the more regimented goaltending techniques when he needs to keep a shooter on their toes. on top of that, precise ﬁnding his parameters around the blue paint, and has a fairly evenly distributed ability stop pucks with his hands. is every goalie coach's dream: a great foundation with evidence that he can layer new tricks on top of it, too. with a few notable exceptions, most swedish-developed goaltenders share a handful of traits in their games — and while embodies a lot of best attributes in net, he can also fall victim to some of the country's weaker habits in net when he's not at the top of his game. his ﬂuid lower-body movements don't leave a tonne of room for creativity, which has him looking beatable at times when facing trickier offensive plays. and perhaps his biggest ﬂaw is his play from his knees; on far too many goals allowed while going through tracked games, struggled with dropping a bit too early and opening up the top of the net. his depth management is both a strength and a weakness for this speciﬁc reason; while he rarely allows the play to sneak behind him, he doesn't take up a ton of room up top. overall, though, remains the best goaltender in the class for a reason. he put up commendable numbers in one of europe's best men's leagues and played lights out in limited action for at the world juniors. you're looking at someone with the potential to be a top-10 starter in the nhl with a little time. twice in the last two years, i have had a goalie in my top 10. this is a rather strange experience for me, especially considering the volatility surrounding goalie projections. however, like askarov last year, it's rare that a player with such a high skillset comes along and, like askarov, i could easily see approaching the top 10 in the draft. at 6'3, 215, is already physically mature, a huge plus for a goalie in today's nhl. on top of that, it's his ability to read the play and adjust accordingly that really stands out. rather than constantly reacting, is able to anticipate the play at an elite level. this allows him to use his excellent technical skills to square up to the shooter and look bigger in the net than he actually is. he is also incredibly calm and rarely panics, a rarity for such a young goaltender. has already played at highest and played the most games of any goalie for lulea. like askarov last season, is a game-changing type goaltender. any team selecting him is getting a bona-fide number one goalie in the near future. calm, cool and collected, is excellent positionally and highly poised in the net. as the puck approaches his net he comes out to the top of his crease and does well to stay with the play positionally. his awareness of the play is also something that stands out and is an elite part of his game. head is constantly swivelling, looking at the options the puck carrier has and prepares himself to change positions to make the save. even though he has incredible anticipation he also doesn't cheat on the play and has incredible timing. his lateral movement is smooth but almost too laid back, at times he seems so comfortable and calm in the net that he almost looks bored when shifting posts at times. in addition to his good mental and physical capabilities, was actively coming out of his net to play the puck and rarely made mistakes with the puck on his stick. once again, he shows, calm poise when under pressure and often makes a good smart pass to a teammate to help aide the breakout. his size and tight positioning allow him to naturally cover a huge portion of the net, even when he drops to his knees. there are no wasted movements and he doesn't scramble when traffic comes to his crease. he holds his posts well and covers the lower net to deny jam plays. his rebound control is incredibly advanced for a goaltender of his age. he isn't the quickest at moving around in his crease, but his movements are controlled and smooth. will need to be quicker in his movements, especially when projecting out to the top of his crease to cut down shooting angles. his glove hand could also be better, as he looks a little too reliant on staying square and hoping the puck hits his glove as opposed to actually catching it, which works a lot of the time but not all the time. the netminder spent his entire season in the an incredible feat for a draft-eligible goaltender in its own even taking over the starting role for a portion of the season.\n",

kelly wrote in a march game report. “his style of play, the habits that worked well in the haven't seemed to translate overseas -- and i did ﬁnd it odd that his teammates rarely wanted to give him the puck on the power play. don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about skill set -- it just seems like there's a bit of a mismatch here.” so, we had to drop pretty drastically in time for the u18 world hockey championships. must've noticed. he went to frisco and plano, texas, and played perhaps the best hockey of his budding career. his work rate soared to new heights. he picked up the pace. he even battled through a little bit of adversity, overcoming a third period benching early in the tournament to play a critical role in helping secure the gold medal. we've more or less split the difference between the two rankings, and that suits us just ﬁne. you just can't drop a player as skilled as any further than this. certainly not in this draft. he's a dual-threat scorer in a class with few prospects who conﬁdently project as much of a singular scoring or shooting threat at the nhl level. the foundation of potency is his hockey sense. he supports his teammates, takes optimal routes to prepare one or two plays in advance, always ﬁnds soft ice in the offensive zone, and times his movements perfectly into those pockets of space to strike. with a no-drawback push release, he's sending the puck home as a capable one- and two-touch ﬁnisher. a gifted setup man, has a wide array of playmaking arrows in his quiver. he'll attract defenders to within his orbit to create space for his linemates, work the give-and-go, and conceal his intentions until the puck ﬂies from his stick. he'll use weight transfers, fakes, freezes -- anything to keep the opposition guessing. some of those same qualities make a pretty serviceable defensive contributor when he wants to put in the work. he tracks well through the neutral zone, makes well-timed interventions in the defensive zone, and takes good lines on loose pucks. the problem is, effort level comes and goes at his leisure. all of those strong defensive habits don't count for much when he's not loading his stride off the puck and making half-assed attempts at collecting loose pucks or contributing in board battles. it's not like has the physical tool kit to be an overwhelming force in any of those scenarios anyway. he's not particularly strong on his skates and pretty easy to keep at bay along the boards. his rounded posture, and a lack of ankle ﬂexion limit his explosiveness as a skater to such a degree that he's never really going to be the ﬁrst to a loose puck either. at this point, i hope you understand why we'd keep a player with such dynamic offensive qualities so relatively low on our board. there are quirks to game that could keep him from playing regular nhl minutes period, much less skating in a team's top-six. he would hardly be the ﬁrst skilled, heady, dual-threat scorer to ﬁnd his prospects of an nhl career undone by a poor work rate and a lack of pace. you just don't pass on players with offensive bona ﬁdes at this point in the draft, though. because if everything works out, that's a top-six scoring winger with power play upside. is a bit of a puzzle, but i firmly believe he will be a solid nhl prospect and player. a victim of the canceled season, excelled at the under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games, and looked dominant at times playing in europe this season. is a versatile, offensive forward. he can play all three forward positions and can easily move up and down a line-up. more of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, is extremely aware of his time and space in the offensive zone, making him a constant threat. he is an excellent passer and while he isn't a shoot-first player, his shot is also above average for his age. some scouts question whether or not he has an extra gear offensively, or if he will be a perpetual support-type middle-six forward. if all the pieces come together, could be a middle-six forward at the nhl with some offensive upside. is an incredibly and dynamic offensively gifted forward. an electric puck possessor, it's nearly impossible to tell what is going to do next when the puck is on his stick. highly deceptive with his use of his edges, twisting and winding through traffic and finding open ice where there seemingly is none. also does a good job of keeping his head up and scanning his options while carrying the puck. he can make sharp passes through tight seems and is incredible at finding those passing and skating lanes. edgework and overall skating abilities are fantastic. he's dynamic and deceptive, and he showed an ability to be able to effectively utilize the 10 and 2 skating style to deceive opponents in different areas of the ice. he makes really tight turns and can change direction on a dime. he utilizes weight shifts to move quickly around defenders, bursting with some speed as he adjusts his pace on the fly. the fearlessness he shows is impressive. he constantly tries to push through traffic, sometimes it pays off, other times he puckhandles himself into a turnover. he has no problem bringing the puck into small-spaces, but getting out is a little hit and miss at times. he has a nose for open space in the offensive zone, using quick edges and light feet to quickly drive the net after sliding behind a defender. his hands move so quick with the puck, matching his feet, however he can get stuck with his head down when in a tight spot. he seems to always be looking for the lanes to the net, quite often finding them. he shows his commitment to the defensive side of the puck as well, often the first forward back and getting deep to help his defenders. he'll also hang back when his defender has jumped up in the rush. there are cases where he needs to speed up his processing as he can hold onto the puck for a little longer when trying to evade an attacker. often shows a willingness to support pucks low in the defensive zone, but can get caught skating with his stick in the air, limiting his ability to stop and disrupt plays and allowing easy passing lanes around him. playing in slovenia, had a strong season playing in a professional men's league.\n",

            " lit up the this season, as one of the few modern-day players to score 50 goals as a 17-year-old. he's one of the best goal-scorers in the and often had more than 10 shot attempts in a game. he's not going to go bar down that often, but his shot is an absolute rocket, and if goalies are not in position, they won't have time to adjust once he lets it go. is also a very good playmaker who makes high-end plays. those 50 goals were complemented with 50 assists. due to his shot and vision, he's an absolute weapon on the man advantage who can run a unit and pick apart defenses. he's skilled but isn't a player who can go end-to-end. he skates ok, but the main criticism of his game is his pace and compete. can often look like he's not going that hard and will have long stretches of indifference. with that said, even in the many games where he looks like he's doing nothing, you'll check the box score and see one goal and two points. thus the question is whether his style of play will translate to the nhl pace. he's one of the most divisive prospects in this year's draft. here's the full list of under-18 forwards who've scored 50 goals in the last decade: jeff skinner, alex debrincat, . nobody in the (though nik ehlers came close with 49 goals in 2014) or the has done it. it's been a long time since patrick marleau did it in 1997, or even since sidney crosby did it in 2004. that's some kind of company. skinner went seventh overall and posted 63 points as a rookie with the carolina hurricanes the following season. debrincat fell to 39th overall due, returned to junior and eventually emerged with a 52-point rookie season of his own. now he's a 40-goal scorer in the nhl and the teams that passed on him regret it. though skill set places him as the least talented of those three players, concerns about his skating and spotty defensive play shouldn't be enough to push him much lower than the late teens in this draft. his one-timer will make him a threat at any level and he's not a one-trick pony, either (i actually really liked the way he opened up his game as a passer this season, something i was worried he wouldn't be able to do after watching him as a rookie). he's going to prove some doubters wrong. the late birthday (june 26, 2001) doesn't hurt either there have been only 13 players in history who scored 51 or more goals in or prior to their under-18 season. with 51 goals and 102 points for a hamilton squad that essentially was in rebuilding mode after winning the championship in 2018, is one of the best scorers in the draft. he shoots off the pass better than anyone, his shot is both heavy and accurate and he does a great job of getting to the goal-scoring areas. on top of that, he has the size (6-foot-2) and strength to get those tough goals at the net-front. his passing is overshadowed by the shot, but he also had 51 assists this season and can make a lot of plays. there are a few concerns with , though. he lacks breakaway speed, though he's probably a little more agile than given credit for. and there are complaints about his consistency of effort. some of that is going to come with maturity, but it is a red flag. even still, he can find the back of the net better than almost anyone else in this draft, and there's always going to be a premium on that. shoot-first winger who knows how to find the back of the net. somewhat one-dimensional but that dimension is spectacular. changes the release point and angle to exploit netminders. protects the puck well. engagement is an issue. as are his first few strides. there's a potential boom here with a hint of bust sprinkled in. a solid skater with good stride power, boasts an accurate and elite shot and has the instincts of a natural goal scorer. he has average foot speed that holds him back in puck races. although he won't wow anyone with explosiveness, he is well balanced on his feet and has a solid top speed when he gets going. dangerous with the puck on his stick, he uses his frame to protect the puck well and possesses a nose for the net. shows better vision and patience on the cycle and finding open teammates across the zone. plays a power forward game when he's engaged, finishing his hits and using his size to open up space in the soft areas of the offensive end. has a very quick release on his shot with great accuracy, making him a threat to score off the rush or use a defender as a screen for his wrist shot. he gets into open space really well in the offensive zone which helps his teammates feed him the puck. scouts have reservations about his work ethic and his play in his own end. his compete level is low as he is the last to forecheck, backcheck and get involved in any kind of physical battle. that being said, he has a good reach on the backcheck and will help support his defenders low in the zone when necessary.\n",

            " is one of the top power forwards available in this year's draft class, and is an outstanding skater, one of the best in the class. he has a fine but not outstanding amount of skill, but gains the offensive zone very often due to his skating ability. has average size (6-0, 192 pounds), but he's pretty strong on the puck and has a fantastic on-ice work ethic. he drives the net, muscles out opponents in battles and gets back on defense effectively. he kills penalties well and he can be a shorthanded scoring threat. another plus: plays both wing and effectively. he's committed to the university of for the 2014-15 season. is a strong, powerful, two-way forward with a high complete level. he is an absolute rocket in his skates and one of the top skaters in this draft. he reaches his top speed very quickly and he gets end to end in seconds. he has great lateral mobility and top-end agility. he uses his quickness to elude opposing defensemen. is a high-end possession player with excellent strength on the puck and great balance on his edges to take the puck wide and muscle his way to the net. he isn't huge, but he is very strong and hard to knock off the puck. he is not overly fashy, but is highly effective, quick and deceptive with the puck. is a highly intelligent player with and without the puck. he makes decisions with the puck, typically the correct ones, almost immediately, and he seems to know what he is doing before he receives a pass. he handles and deals out passes very well. he is a quick, effcient puck-mover with the ability to set up teammates and make plays happen. has a very good shot with a great release. it isn't just the quickness of his release that's impressive, but it is the deception. he will make you think pass, and you'll be wrong. he has a very good wrist-shot with a good release and he gets into very good scoring positions. he does seem to be a pass-frst player, though. effort never wanes and he gives his best each shift. he is a high-compete, high-intelligence, three-zone he doesn't destroy players with his big, physical hits, but he does a great job riding guys off the puck and outmuscling players to win possession. he battles and competes hard for the puck. his defensive effort is just as good as his effort with the puck. he is smart and gets into great supporting areas, and he does a great job adjusting to the position and decisions of his linemates. he backchecks hard and gets into good areas to help on defense. he supports well down low and impedes with a quick, active stick and aggressive playing style. the biggest knock on is his limited projected offensive upside. while he does project to be a strong nhl player, it will be in a two-way role that he will make his money, not as a prime offensive point producer. a david legwand or poor man's ryan kesler type of pro upside is the projection for and one has to wonder if this limitation will cause his stock to drop marginally\n",

            " is my top ranked defenseman in this draft class. he was often asked to play 30 minutes a game for the giants, showing immense offensive potential, including leading the playoffs in scoring. is a high-end skater with the ability to lead a rush and close gaps. he's got quick-twitch feet and a great first step. he's very active with his skating, as i often see him join rushes and lead ones, and he can activate well off the blueline. he's very skilled. i don't think he's truly tapped into how good offensively he can be despite his great numbers. he's got fantastic puck skills. i've watched him in practice manipulate the puck at an elite level. while he makes plenty of skilled plays, i think his individual creativity has another level than he's shown. i didn't see him consistently make high-end passes through seams at the offensive blueline. he has that in his game, but at times he relies on his skating and shot. he's a very patient and poised player who sees the game develop and has great outlets, which is why i give his iq a 60 grade. has an accurate shot and scored quite a few difficult goals from a distance this season. defensively he's solid with good gaps, awareness and compete level, plus some physical edge; but it's how often the team has the puck when he's on the ice that makes him so good. vancouver giants coach michael dyck on : “his ability to jump away from checks is elite. he's got a great first four steps. he moves well laterally across the blue line. he can defend speed off the rush. his puck skills are elite. he can move the puck and has a great sense to find the open man and playing fast.” i've already broken down game as the best defenceman in the draft and a frontrunner for third overall in considerably more detail here but the short of it is that while there is still work to be done on his defensive play, particularly with his effort and his spacial awareness within defensive zone schemes, is one of the better goal scoring defencemen the nhl draft has seen in recent memory. furthermore, he is an excellent three-zone passer and a strong skater who can recover from mistakes made pushing the play into the high slot if the puck goes back the other way. and he just keeps getting better, and better and better. the of the last half of the season and into the playoffs was one of the best players in junior hockey. has been a significant riser and is an exceptional talent. there are teams that view as a future no. 1 defenseman. there is no denying that he has some incredible offensive skill, but i would like to see become a bit more consistent as a defender. i think the skating is excellent, and he has a good sense of how to play efficiently in a boatload of minutes. he willed vancouver to the final this season, and that's going to resonate. one scout i spoke to expressed concern that the way scored goals -- popping deep into zones and aggressively jumping plays -- won't translate to the nhl. i think elements of it can, but he will have to become a bit more selective. he's the best defenseman in this draft by a fairly large margin, but the highly touted forwards available in this draft offer a bit more long-term value. the threshold of a future no. 1 defenseman is pretty high, and i'm not sure is there yet for me. but he's close and a definite top-10 talent in this class. the gap in quality between and the next best defenceman in this class might be more significant than any other two subsequent defencemen in this class. that's equal parts quality as a defender and the quality of the group that follows him. the shallowness in this year's class is going to contribute in a significant way to going, in all likelihood, with one of the first five picks, where he might be closer to ten in most years. all that said, is an excellent offensive defenceman that has all the skills to be a dynamic point producer from the blue line at the nhl level. every facet of skating is at a high, high-level; his acceleration, mobility, and top-end speed are all projectable to the nhl. hockey sense is the binding ingredient that puts it all together into a coherent, delectable package. he sees the ice as well as anyone from the back-end in this year's class. one of the main knocks on is that he can appear to float from time to time and has a tendency to skate himself into trouble. there might be something to that. i've seen instances of both. that said, has the highest on-ice goals for percentage on the team, is second in points, and is top ten in the in estimated time-on-ice at 5-on-5. if that's what can do without giving a full-effort, imagine what happens when his ice-time drops and doesn't need to conserve energy. there's only one defenceman in this class that i project as a no. 1 defenceman at the nhl level with any certainty, and that's, . and i do so with a significant degree of certainty at that. was a leading member of the vancouver giants that pushed the prince albert raiders to overtime in game 7 for the title. he was a constant on the ice for the giants, rising to nearly 30 estimated minutes at 5-on-5 per game, and remaining a highly-effective offensive defenceman from puck drop to the final horn, night in and night out. there aren't any glaring holes in game. he's an excellent skater, with good balance, explosiveness and a high-end top-gear. i've found that hockey sense is high-end and that he can make the game look effortless to him as a result. i've heard some in the industry express concerns about his ability to defend, but those concerns seem overstated in my estimation. does a good job of holding the blue line, and he uses an active stick to interrupt passing lanes and disrupt oncoming puck-carriers. some believe that can step into an nhl lineup as soon as next season. i'm not sure that i'm that bullish on , but he's not far off. one year at the very most. it is rare that a defenseman scores over 20 goals in any league in this day and age, and yet put up 26 in his draft eligible, one of the highest totals in recent memory. is the only true #1 defenseman prospect in this draft. is an elite skater and has tremendous upside. he also performs in high pressure situations, as shown by his ability to produce in the playoffs and in overtime games. has the ability to drive play, something that is rare amongst defenseman. projects as a true #1, first pairing defenseman at the nhl level. showing elite offensive potential, uses his strong skating and offensive instincts to drive the play. a prototypical two-way defenseman, he's able to mobilize his big body on the attack and in his own zone, changing the landscape of the play by accelerating and pushing the game at his pace. a vital catalyst to his team, he anticipates the play extremely well in transition and on offense. at times, he can look disinterested in his defensive responsibilities and his positioning in his own zone can be iffy. this could be due to the fact that he logs so many minutes for vancouver on the blue line. he does possess all the tools to improve his defensive game. he's excellent on the breakout and is great at creating offense from the back end, which is what every team wants on their top pairing. perfectly suited for today's possession-based game, he's unflappable under pressure and usually finds ideal passing or skating lanes out of his own end and into the offensive zone. he has a quick shot that is accurate, but still needs to put in work to get more power behind it. possessing excellent vision, creativity and awareness, he's a highly-precise passer who connects quickly and efficiently with teammates to get pucks out of his own zone. he also has the adept awareness to lead and be deceptive in delivery.\n",

            "player name: {} Ivan Miroshnichenko\n",
            " is a player with all the attributes you want in a top nhl winger. he's got good size and strength. he's a strong skater. he's highly skilled. he can make plays and he's highly competitive. his shot is a bullet and can be a weapon from the flank on a pro power play. he can beat defenders with speed, he can put pucks through legs, he can create at even strength and on the power play. he has a bulky frame and can play a powerful style of game. he has the tools and track record of a projected top line winger, but given his diagnosis he is being placed several tiers below that due to the significant uncertainty in his future projection — despite positive developments since the initial diagnosis. is the hardest player in this year's draft class to rank because of his health following a hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis in early 2022. the latest update is that he has completed his treatment in germany and has been cleared to resume training under a full load in so that's a big positive. teams are all having the same conversations about where their threshold would be in the draft to take him. i've settled here, after the core group of 27 players that i believe strongest in. for context, was widely regarded as best prospect in this draft before the diagnosis, even after a so-so start to his season had pushed him from the top three conversation into more of a top-10 projection (before i learned of the diagnosis, he slotted 11th on my list, which was a smidge lower than most). as a player, has an illustrious international track record as a captain and first-line player in his age group (often alongside 2023 sensation matvei michkov) and a good though less inspiring domestic track record. there are some exciting attributes to his game and it's well rounded, so it's never been hard to understand the appeal. he's got an athletic pro frame. he shoots it hard (both his wrister and his one-timer/off one-touch shots) from mid range, giving him clear power-play upside. he's a powerful skater through his edges and crossovers. he's got good playmaking instincts. he's a dexterous player who catches bad passes, manages to keep control when the play breaks down or the ice is choppy, and gets his stick on tips, etc. and he's noticeably engaged shift to shift without the puck. my big hiccup with him is that i don't find him to be a great problem-solver. while he can make the first play he sees on instinct, he doesn't do a good job breaking down the play to think it through. no matter where he lands on draft day, it'll be a testament to his status as a prospect and the pro style that he played before the diagnosis. worth noting: though he's ranked 28th here, not all of the players i have in front of him will be drafted in the first round, which means i probably wouldn't be prepared to take the gamble on until somewhere in the middle of the second round when the above players are gone. the projection for might change throughout the season. but, at first glance, i believe you are looking at a second line forward. if he can work on his shot, he has the potential to be lethal at the nhl level. but, i truly believe that his shot will hold him back if further does not occur. if not for a hodgkins lymphoma diagnosis earlier this year, we could be talking about as a top-10 pick in this class. reports suggest that his prognosis is positive and that will be able to resume his career as early as next season. still, it's a factor in his projection and there's a lot of risk. the potential for reward, however, is extraordinarily high, especially if a team can land him later in the first round. is a powerful, fast player who is difficult to defend as he uses his strength to gain an advantage on the opposition. he has quick hands and a deadly shot that he can let go from anywhere, but it's his propensity for driving the middle that makes me believe he's going to be a talented scorer at the nhl level. he attempted to follow the same exact path as andrei svechnikov by coming to north america at 16, playing in the and then probably going to the but a visa issue prevented him from coming to play for the muskegon lumberjacks two years ago. is under contract for two more seasons, but he burns to play in the nhl. a jackhammer of a forward. skates fast. shoots hard. hits harder. the health is concerning. the stagnation from his draft-minus-one is concerning. and sadly, the passport is likely concerning for some teams as well. could end up as a very useful piece all over the lineup if things break on pure talent alone, we've probably placed a solid 10-plus spots lower on our board than he belongs. the factor, more complicated than ever this year, and a hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis have made his evaluation incredibly fraught, though. the good news, as of this writing, is that is believed to have cleared treatment and is already training in preparation for next season. here's hoping that holds true and that the omsk product can continue his playing career and live a healthy, fulfilling life free from the grips of this malady. ultimately, his health comes first. getting back to the hockey side of things, is one of this draft's more obviously physically gifted players. all of his tools check out as an average-to-above-average projection if not better, and his release is among the best in this class. he's one of the draft's credible finishers from a range, a sniper with an evident separating skill around which he can build an nhl identity. everything you look for to project an elite finisher to the nhl level is there in game: shot volume, the variety of releases, and the use of screens and traffic to increase the odds. his one-timer is a legitimate cannon, one that made him the centrepiece of omskie krylia's power play in the vhl last season. \"on the power play, he shows more patience, more foresight, waiting for lanes to open, keeping himself deceptive until teammates get in position,\" elite prospects lead scout wrote in an early-season game report. \"he didn't score in this game, but i liked his shot mechanics. good knee-bend and follow through. the releases looked hard and well-aimed. he looks like a one-timer threat.\" read between the lines, and you may notice how careful we are to qualify his best off-puck work as occurring on the power play. that's not by accident. play at even strength consistently our team wanting, particularly early in the year. \"really bad movement off the puck and was constantly trailing the rush,\" elite prospects regional scout dylan griffing wrote of in an october game report. \"[he] took himself completely out of the play by sitting on his team's blue line while his two linemates were on their way into the offensive zone. shot selection was weak, just started shooting from anywhere and everywhere in the late stages of the game.\" his off-puck diligence improved as the season wore on, to the point where it almost rated as a strength for our staff in later viewings. so, credit where it's due on that front, even if getting there took far more time than it should have for a player with his reputation and pedigree. there's more to than just his shot, though. he's a naturally skilled puckhandler, and his forward stride rates as above average even if the mechanical form isn't exactly what you'd call textbook. when his motor is running at top gear (not always a given), there's also a physical side to his game that bears mentioning; he punched way above his stocky 6-foot-1, 185-pound frame against men in the vhl last season. the central conceit of miroschnichenko's game is that he's a hammer and that he views everything and everyone on the ice as a nail -- pucks and opponents alike. it's also the reason that we've been a bit cool on his game relative to many of our peers in the scouting community. he's more than just a shot, but not that much more, and it's not like we consistently saw the off-puck savvy from that's baked into the game of every one of the nhl's best finishers. it's not impossible to imagine a scenario where rounds out his game and develops into a top-line sniper at the nhl level, but we envision a more modest future for the winger a bit further down the lineup. an exceptionally hard player to evaluate, had an up and down season. he was also diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer, that sidelined him for a large portion of the season. when the year began, was a top-five pick on most public lists. his combination of size, skill, and offensive ability appeared to make him a bonafide top 10 pick. however, before the diagnosis, struggled to put up points in this doesn't mean he doesn't have the tools to succeed, however. similar to yurov, has a well-rounded offensive game. he is a powerful skater with the puck on his stick and loves to tee up for one-timers. he has an excellent release and isn't afraid to enter into tough areas on the ice. there are continuing questions surrounding health, as well as questions regarding his status playing in next season. he has tried to play in north america in the past, and perhaps there's a path forward this season, which could help his draft stock somewhat. if everything comes together, miroschnichenko is a potential top-six forward at the nhl level. he is likely 3-4 years away. , who was diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma in march, is a goal-scoring winger who excels at shot generation and owns one of the draft's best shots. he has long been considered one of the top scoring talents due to his advanced ability as a shooter and his ability to get open in soft areas of ice to make himself available to teammates. he owns a quick and deceptive release on his wrist shot, and he's able to shoot in stride and shoot off both feet with power and accuracy to beat netminders from range. he also owns a great one-timer, able to generate tremendous torque on the shaft of his stick get the puck on goal with power. it makes him a major weapon on the power play when set up in the circle on his off-wing. he also displays puck skills as a plus attribute, particularly when it comes to his hand-eye coordination. he's able to corral off-target passes in his feet or away from his body, which increases his threat as a scorer as it does not take a perfect pass to set him up in a high-danger scoring area. he is also a plus skater, able to move north-south well with good speed and acceleration that allows him to attack in transition. he's also a regularly engaged player and is able to fight through checks, showing good strength with the puck on his stick. where he will need to find improvement in order to become a top-flight producer at the pro level is an added level to his creativity with the puck on his stick. he's capable of delivering passes to teammates and has reliable instincts, but struggles to break down well-positioned defenses. is a well-rounded forward with the tools to be a high-end top-six scorer, and will need to improve creativity to reach that.\n",

his intelligence, passing ability, off-puck awareness and aggressiveness will still make him an effective offensive defensemen. if his mobility is able to reach a level that isn't too far off from where he is now: an aggressive projection for would be an elite offensive catalyst from the backend with the ability to mitigate defensive zone transitions which would erase concerns about his size. conservatively, he projects as an aggressive, high-event style defensemen who you bet will create more chances than he'll give up. i, personally, lean to his highest ceiling due to his consistent impact on the offensive end of the ice in my viewings, but the concerns are valid. a high-end, playmaking defenseman who has excellent mobility thanks to superior edge work and skating ability, might not get as much love as some of the next-tier defensemen because of his average size. that said, he's not so small that it will distract anyone from what he's able to do with the puck on his stick. he reads defenses well, gets pucks to the places at the time and has supreme confidence in his overall ability. i think he defends at a very solid level, but i don't know that it's so good you can say he's a surefire top-four, big-minutes defenseman. based on the offensive toolkit, though, i think he is definitely in that discussion and could be one of the more talented blueliners to come out of this draft. there's never been a play that didn't want to get a touch on. he activates into the play extremely well, providing support, leading the rush, or opening up lanes. his rush defence has blossomed this season, and the awareness is high-end. there's a world where he ends up as the most impactful defender in the crop. his style is where the defensive position is heading. treats his positional assignment like a suggestion, one he defies with reckless abandon. he's a mercenary every time he takes the ice, unbound by even the most time-honoured conventions of his role. it's like he's everywhere at once, shouldering an enor-mous burden for his team like it's nothing at all -- cueing the breakout, leading the rush or joining it as a trailer, supporting the puck, leading the forecheck (yes, seriously), shutting it down between the blue lines, and containing in small-area defensive scenarios. \"the result of the constant activation is numerous,\" elite prospects dir. of north scouting wrote in a mid-season scout's notebook. \"for one, mat-eychuk averages 150 puck touches per game, more than 50 above the average top pairing defenceman. the activation ensures he's always gapped up in the event of a turnover, which blends with his projectable rush defence and play-killing instincts. and he's always sprinting up the ice. it's exhausting to be on the opposite side.” some of that is going to change as the talent pool com-presses around the winnipeg-born blueliner. it'll have to. the considerable skills advantage that informs freewheeling, caution-to-the-wind playing style in the won't be there at the next level. not to the same degree, anyway. this, of course, says nothing of the willingness of even the most progressive nhl bench bosses to let this happen on their watch. his style may have to change (though to what degree is unknown), but that doesn't mean that quality has to diminish too much as a result. there are many projectable parts that make up the sum of his game; components that, individually, all rate as average-to-above-average nhl projections. let's start with the warriors defender's transition game; we'll build this picture from the goal line out. is clinical on the breakout, scanning for threats and options on the retrieval, stacking deception onto his first touch, dragging the f1 into the defensive zone only to dart past him -- it's all too easy for him. his forward stride may lack a separating gear, but his four-way mobility, puck-protection mechanics, and the ability to find outlets under pressure make him nearly untouchable. constant motion allows to break from his team's structure in the offensive zone and seek opportunities that just aren't there for other defencemen. he prods for soft ice, finds it, and times his entrance into that space at the best possible moment for a shooting opportunity or a chance to hit his teammate elsewhere with a perfectly weighted pass for a chance of their own. taking things back in the other direction, does his best defensive work in the neutral zone. he gaps up early, maintains good backwards skating posture, takes away space with his stick, and angles opponents excep-tionally well. things get a bit more helter-skelter for during in-zone defensive sequences, but it's still a part of his game that projects as average-to-above-average at the nhl level. his switches aren't great, but he generally does a good job of identifying off-puck threats and acting proactively to take away their time and space. the evolution of game will be a fascinating part of his to track. there just isn't really a blueprint or a set of priors to lean on for someone with his profile. that makes him one of if not the most com-pelling player in this draft, if nothing else. overall, though, we're reasonably confident in ability to find his way and carve out a top-four career in the nhl. it's just a matter of how he does it, and that's more of a point of curiosity than anything. a stereotypical modern-day defender, averaged a point-per-game in the and his offensive game stood out leaps and bounds. is a highly intelligent player and an excellent passer. his speed stands out and he loves to use it to get out of trouble in the defensive zone and to move the puck up the ice quickly in the offensive zone. highly mobile, plays an overall mature game. while his offense stands out clearly, he is solid defensively as well. he has excellent gap control and breaks up plays with ease. overall, projects as a top-four defender at the nhl level. he needs to gain some strength, but his size shouldn't be an issue at the nhl level. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. is an offensively gifted defenseman who exudes confidence when he has the puck. his desire to be a difference-maker is noticeable every time he steps on the ice. he's a terrific skater who has a wide stance with a low of gravity which allows him to get a lot of power with each stride. coupled with the powerful stride, he displays great edgework that he's able to utiilize in many ways, whether it's working the offensive blue line to get a better lane to the net, making opponents miss as he's rushing the puck up the ice, or shaking forecheckers off as he retrieves the puck in his own end to start a breakout. he also processes the game at an elite level, which makes him a force in the offensive zone. he's great at picking his spots to pinch in order to sustain pressure for his team, and he reads the play so well that he's able to jump off the blue line into some open ice to make himself a dangerous option. the odd time one of his reads doesn't go as planned, he's got the determination to get back in time defensively to minimize any opportunity against his team. he can be an aggressive defender in his own zone, too. he uses his anticipation to cut off cycle attempts or any cross-ice passes near him. due to him trying to read the play so often, there are moments where he can lose his check because he's trying so hard to beat the puck to where it's going next. he can shore that up as he matures. he could also benefit from adding weight to his frame. he's just not able to impose himself physically on others, which may hinder his defensive abilities. best-case projection could be as high as a top-pair blueliner, but can become a top-four who quarterback's a power play unit.\n",

            " has had a very good season between and the world juniors, continuing a trend of being one of the most important players on whatever team he's on. he was a possession beast for university and towards the end of the season became one of the team's better playmakers. he has one of the best physical games in the draft. he's a strong 6-foot-3 forward who wins battles and bulldozes his way to the net as well as any teenager i've seen in the ranks. any scout i talk to will immediately heap praise on his competitiveness and the edge in his game. his skill isn't dynamic, but he has good hands, a good wrist shot and makes smart plays with the puck. he's a very smart player, can distribute the puck well and doesn't make many poor decisions. i saw the occasional high-end flash of vision from him, but he does make quick decisions and plays at a pro pace. his skating is solid, as well. i've seen him turn the corner on defenders numerous times, but he's never going to wow you with his speed. coaches will love him because he plays well in any situation or role. one of the oldest players in the class, was one day shy of ending up in the 2017 draft. as a result, you'd expect him to be several months ahead of a lot of the players in this class. in terms of his physical tools, he is. has always played above his age. while many of his teammates played in under-17s last year, he captained the under-18 team and posted a point per game. while wahlstrom and co. played in u18s this year, he was a standout at the world juniors and in he doesn't have the high-end upside of the three forwards ahead of him, but he brings a physicality and mean spirit that all, but svechnikov lack. he's an overpowering presence whose strong stride allows him to attack in waves and get to the front of the net to finish off plays. he's also an underrated passer and while i don't suspect he'll become the primary scoring threat on a first line in the nhl, i can absolutely envision him playing on one and making an impact. he'll be a good fit with a lot of different kinds of players. \"he's just a junkyard dog,\" as team world juniors coach bob motzko said while starred at the tournament. that remains my favorite description of . taking all of the qualities of his physical play and combining that with his elite hockey sense, better-than-average puck skills for a big man and a commitment to being a force in all zones, can help a team in so many ways. playing with the edge that has become a family trademark -- dad keith and brother matthew have displayed it in their own nhl careers -- i can't imagine is very fun to line up against. but you have to be more than be big and tough. that's where the hockey sense becomes a separating factor. made confident plays with the puck on his stick during his days. when he was out there, there was a good chance bu was tilting the ice in their favor. however, that didn't always lead to offense, as he scored just eight goals this season, despite averaging more than three shots on goal per game (131). point total certainly isn't eye-popping, which is why there is at least some trepidation with him as a top-four pick. that said, i've had a hard time running into scouts who wouldn't take him in the top five, especially once those other three are off the board. the elder statesman of the 2018 crop missed last year's draft by a single day. had an adequate season as one of the younger players in the but his lights out world junior showing moved the needle for many. his hands are soft, his shot is heavy and he plays an abrasive, pro-style game. he'll be a fan favourite. big body & isn't afraid to use it. plays all 200 feet of the rink & loves those dirty areas a top-end winger, he is an above-average skater, with a top speed that can beat defenders wide. his burst could still be improved, but his advanced strength makes up for a lack of quickness in tight areas. his offensive awareness stands out and he always seems to be in the position for a one-timer or a feed to one of his teammates. for a bigger forward, he has good puckhandling ability. he excels at taking passes in stride, then heading into the offensive zone with a head of steam. he does have a habit of overplaying the puck at times, trying an extra move at the offensive blue line and losing possession, instead of dumping the puck deep and forechecking. but he is capable of impressive moves under pressure. he has a great shot and the confidence to fire it on net from anywhere in the offensive zone. the release is quick and the accuracy is good. with his power, he can be a force in the offensive zone. he's not afraid to fight through contact to make a play. can be very aggressive physically and can pester opponents relentlessly. but defensively he could use his strength better. in his own zone, he's not engaged every shift. but he does use his speed to pressure on the backcheck. he's not afraid to come down low in his own end to make positive plays. a full toolbox which comes as a result of strong nhl bloodlines.\n",

            " had a good season in the slightly more was expected of him coming into the year, but he still was one of the more dangerous forwards in the league offensively. is a talented offensive player who stands out when he has the puck on his stick. he's very skilled, showing the ability to beat opponents often with his stick skills and can do so on the move. he skates well enough to play at higher levels. can create offense with his skill, but also makes plays to his teammates very well and has a shot that can finish from mid-range. he's an undersized player who is just ok off the puck and physically. in a sentence, projects as an nhl bottom-six forward. a year ago, after the chicago steel's record-breaking 2019-20 season was abruptly ended by the covid-19 pandemic, the team's general manager, ryan hardy, told me — who was only his team's eighth-leading scorer — was his most purely-gifted player. this year, in a more prominent role, season was marked by some highs and lows as he tried to put it all together and take over. his ability with the puck and the speed with which he's able to execute both rank among the very best in this draft. his feet and hands can both keep up with one another, turning defenders on their heels (and sometimes inside out). there's a genius to his game that allows him to see plays through layers that others don't, and then he's got the finesse needed to feather saucer passes off of his forehand and backhand and execute them. i love the way he moves inside the offensive zone and the high tempo he plays with. and while he's not a big player, i wouldn't categorize him as small or weak, with decent strength through the base of his stride that allows him to keep sequences alive. i'd like to see him look to attack underneath to the inside a little more and his numbers don't pop as much as his skill level does, but he's still a first-round talent. will join in the fall. is an offensive minded forward who can certainly rack up the points, all while making his game a spectacular sight to see. he's been on chicago's top two lines for pretty much the entire 2020/21 season, usually paired up with matthew coronato and erik middendorf. when those three are on the ice, it's practically an offensive clinic for fans to watch. is amazingly patient with the puck on his stick, and can wait out almost any defender or goaltender in the aside from his patience, he also has one wicked wrist shot, which he can utilize from pretty much anywhere in the offensive zone. he's played mainly on the wing since returning from injury in late february, but he's scored pretty much all his goals from the left-side slot. as is mainly utilized in the offensive zone (48% of game action), he isn't used much in defensive zone setups or on the penalty kill. however, he is more than capable of being relied upon in his own zone. has such poise picking out a teammate for a breakout pass, or can simply turn on the jets and create a scoring opportunity off the rush. this skilled speedster averaged more than a point per game for the steel when healthy this season, and another 10 points in eight playoff contests. a member of the hockey family -- siblings madison and melissa are forces in the game -- the future wolverine is admired for his creative use of the ice and great anticipation, thinking a step or two ahead of the play. he sets up teammates with regularity and can score himself. one of the more gifted skaters available, remains a threat to squeak into the top-20 come draft day. at this stage, an absence of grit serves as a minor turnoff. is an offensive buzzsaw, cutting through opposing defenders and stringing together highlight-reel plays with relative ease. you don't want to miss when he's feeling it. you give the puck in space, and he makes everything look effortless. he'll blend pass receptions into highly creative dangles around defenders, with top-hand control of his stick pushed out from his body, and quick-twitch wrists to string it all together. he's agile enough to chain together and combine moves and dextrous enough to repair handling mistakes. he manages space exceptionally well, constantly scanning for the positions of his teammates and opponents alike. and he uses that mental map of the ice to plan his every manoeuvre one or two plays ahead of the competition. so many of his best plays start in the neutral zone. shouldered much of the transition burden for the steel regardless of the line on which he played. even if the skating base isn't quite there, he manages to get by just ﬁne with his advanced habits. he uses linear and non-linear crossovers to accelerate between the blue lines, changes of tempos and speeds, hesitations, and a wide array of rush patterns to create space. elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell tracked a wide sample of and games from the 2020-21 season, and created more controlled zone entries at 5-on-5 than any other player in that sample. just imagine what could do with a cleaner skating stride. his posture is poor, hunched over, leaving him top-heavy, pressing against the centre of his mass rather than engaging his core through each stride. there isn't any ankle ﬂexion, and his upper body is wholly unrestrained at points. he's hardly crawling out there. many of his skating habits cover ground where his stride is otherwise inefﬁcient and limiting. it's still only about an nhl average tool, though. and it's a tool that is vitally important to his offensive approach. there are tools in his toolkit, though. knack for ﬁnding soft-ice off the puck coupled with his top-ﬂight puck skills make for a pretty lethal combination in-tight. if his teammates can get him the puck, then is going to do damage. he's also a pretty crafty playmaker. he carefully plans his passes, creating passing lanes with subtle movements and acts of deception. there's also his touch as a playmaker; , as he's known by his teammates, always puts the weight on his passes for the situations. just don't expect much board work from . frankly, he's a bit of a pushover. his feet stop moving and most defenders can shove him off the puck with a stern look. it's not like he's much more sturdy off of the wall, but it's a real issue along the boards. “the same weaknesses were there,” our lead scout said of in a march game report. “balance and anything that resembles close-quarter hockey on the boards. he simply can't protect the puck along the walls against backpressure -- too weak, too unstable, and not elusive enough.” the same principle applies in the defensive zone. isn't a particularly high work rate player in the defensive zone to begin with. it's not like it would make much of a difference if he showed up anyway. he just isn't strong enough to separate anyone from the puck, short of with a poke-check. his path is pretty straightforward. he'll need to bulk up -- that's the starting point. you put a bit of muscle on , and one has to imagine that his wall play takes a big step in the direction. he'll need to integrate some give-and-go offence to complement his possession game. those are pretty minor obstacles for a player in who has the potential to hang as a low-end top-six scoring winger. he's committed to the university of for the 2021-22 season. another chicago steal gem, samoskovich may have a higher ceiling than his teammate matthew coronato. however, there are still some overall significant strides that need to be taken for him to be in that category, though there is a rather small margin between them. is a player that creates space well for his teammates. his overall high-end offensive skill, including elite hands, allow for him to drive offense and maintain offensive zone possession. he has above-average speed and there is the potential for there to be a dynamic element to his game. showed this in flashes last season and will be given loads of opportunities at next season. biggest area of improvement is consistency, both in his offense and from game to game. there are games when he shows “flashes” of high-end skill, but is otherwise quiet. at other times, he could have a quiet game or two in a row as well. he averaged a point-per-game at the significantly less than some of his other teammates who are considered to potentially have higher skill than. however, scouts aren't overly concerned and believe positive consistency will come with continued age and maturity. overall, only has room to grow and whatever team drafts him will need to give him the time and space. he will need a good three years of before he is nhl ready. projects as a potential top-six forward at the nhl level. while a smaller player, plays a big game. he excels in the offensive zone, reading the play well and driving the net with or without the puck. his offensive awareness is excellent, knowing how to find the open ice and finding the lanes to the net. he's fearless in his drives to the net and in jumping into puck battles. with the puck in the offensive zone, his best trait might be his playmaking. he does this with a mixture of good puck movement, a level of deception, and that awareness of where everyone is on the ice. he does have a good shot as well, although he doesn't utilize this as much. he has a quick release that can fool netminders. his skating is very good, showing fast and explosive movement with the puck through the neutral zone. he also has strong edges, utilizing them to create separation from opponents. his hands are so quick and strong, he can weave in and out of traffic without missing a beat. he positions the puck well in his hip pocket and knows how to best position it away from opponents. he has the hockey sense and poise with the puck to hold onto it a bit longer to allow the opposition to break down and allow lanes to open up. he plays with a great deal of composure and determination, while maintaining a high-tempo pace. is extremely dangerous in all situations, with the ability to play on both special teams. in the defensive zone, he has the ability and awareness to pick off passes, get in lanes, and disrupt plays. he can have shifts that are very strong in his own end, tying up opponents, battling hard, boxing players out, and regularly being in the place. at the same time, he has a tendency to leave the zone early at even strength, looking to create offense. this can get him caught at times, leaving his team shorthanded in their own zone. biggest area of opportunity is to continue to build strength. he has the intelligence and skill to be a contributing player at the next level, adding more strength will be an important piece of the puzzle for him.\n",

instead of back and out through the arches of his feet. he's also not a particularly dynamic offensive presence. he's not scary when he's out there. what he is, though, is one of the most complete hockey players in the draft. he's an excellent defensive player who has a knack for disrupting and lifting pucks, is always in sound position, and supports the play low before he even thinks about going the other way. the latter tool helps him be available for his linemates and involve through the neutral zone without needing to be fast. he also does a good job creating separation with his go-to stop-up to force defenders off of him and allow him to attack back into the space they've behind. he has also managed to produce at a consistently high level against his peers despite lacking that high-end quality that most first-round forwards possess. he's able to do that for some of the same reasons he's so effective without the puck: a lot of quick, smart plays and his understanding of spacing. i don't want this to position him as unskilled, either, because he's not. he's plenty capable of carrying the puck and making plays in the offensive zone. in fact, against his peers, those tools can sometimes really shine. he made progress in the vhl once he began playing a little less passive there, too. but the real strength of his game is in its details. earlier, we briefly brought up robust defensive play, but there is plenty to drool over. first of all, is very aggressive to the puck, puts in the same amount effort in every single shift and can be very frustrating for anyone in possession of the puck. with his acceleration and speed, he is electric and will go after the puck no matter the zone. in the defensive zone, he will do well under duress and can evade the forecheck with ease. he pivots out and wiggles his ways through. he also does a great job putting on the pressure and adjusting to puck movement on the fly. when positioning on the wing, he finds the perfect spot to be in to allow for quick movements when looking to shut down the cycle. if he is defending the rush and trying to keep his opponents in low danger, he deploys tight man on man defense to keep the opponent stuck along the boards. in terms of his own puck movement and skating up the ice on the rush, sometimes he needs to be more cautious with his decision making. on occasion, he will have an attacker riding alongside him and he will look to deliver a pass through the attackers' legs, he will misread how close the attacker is to him and cause a turnover. there are also times where he positions the puck too far wide, especially around the perimeter and drags the puck further out to low danger along the boards. if he keeps the puck tighter and closer to his body, he will have far more success and will be able to manufacture scoring chances in medium danger. methodical and responsible, is most often found where he should be on the ice in any given situation. his vision is next-level. absence of sparkling scoring numbers aside, the solidly built forward is committed to the 200-foot game and serves as a valuable asset in all three zones. he's also committed to st. petersburg next season, where we'll get a better sense of what he's capable. 10-point output at the under-18 championship suggests he might have more offensive upside than generally thought. fyodor plays an honest 200-foot game, and he's already moved on to play productive minutes in the vhl after quickly outgrowing the confines of the mhl. our scout, david st. louis, caught during some of his crossover work and came away thoroughly impressed with his high-level habits and defensive details. plays with a fair bit of pace too, which is rare in his neck of the woods. he isn't the most skilled, but there's enough there to get by. you're not going to ﬁnd many more intelligent, detail-oriented defensive centres in the 2021 nhl entry draft than fyodor . certainly, it's hard to imagine you'll ﬁnd one past this point in the draft. if you want a player built for tough matchups, killing penalties, and taking critical faceoffs late in games -- is your guy. he's going to be a favourite of whichever coach is fortunate enough to place him on their lineup card. everything in game starts with his habits. he's always scanning the ice for threats and options when he's off of the puck, maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice so that he's always prepared for what comes next. “[] rarely misses a beat in ladia's system, taking the positions at the times, showing a clear mental separation between offensive sequences and defensive ones,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a mid-season proﬁle. “one won't ﬁnd any cheating in game. where most in his age cohort display a dangerous level of enthusiasm for rush attacks, jumping early from their positions before their team has established control of the puck, demonstrates a veteran's patience. he waits for a clear change in possession to move up-ice in a controlled, supportive fashion.” takes great routes off of the puck, rotates above the puck, and often dips low into the defensive zone to create a numbers advantage in support of his teammates. he anticipates opposition routes exceptionally well and makes well-timed interventions on developing plays as they take shape. game reports are lined almost from the start of the season to its end with “perfect defensive outing,” or some variation of that sentence. he was the best defensive forward every time he stepped over the boards. that consistency was something our scouts really came to admire. if hockey sense is the force multiplier at every corner of the ice (and has that quality in spades…), then a player's work ethic is what elevates their defensive game beyond the sum of its parts. work rate is unimpeachable. he makes second and third efforts where others back off -- whatever it takes to secure possession. the data that our dir. of north scouting mitchell and dir. of european scouting lassi alanen collected from the u18 world hockey championships showcases his admirable defensive effort. our partners at instat hockey tracked on-ice data from that tournament as well, and they also frame contributions as distinctly positive. out-attempted the opposition 134-76, good for a 66 percent ratio of control with on the ice at even strength. it's not enough to just be a sturdy defensive piece in the top half of the ﬁrst round. you need to offer some level of offence at the next level. art ross trophies won't line the walls of the estate when he hangs up the skates, but he'll bring more than enough offence to hang in an nhl middle-six. that seems like the ﬂoor for a player this sharp. the supporting instincts that make so effective in the defensive zone are every bit as potent when his team is on the attack. his sense of offensive timing is fantastic, and he has a really great knack for getting open off of the puck. sometimes, he'll just hide in a defender's blind spot, then spring open for a scoring chance from seemingly out of nowhere. the forward for the upcoming season deﬁnitely proﬁles as more of a playmaker than a ﬁnisher. drags defenders into his orbit as a puck-carrier to create space for his linemates. he's a technically skilled distributor -- with the full array of reach-adjusting passes in his arsenal -- able to get the puck to his teammates through layers. unfortunately, though, offensive tools grade out as about average almost across the board, save for his 6.5-grade puck skills. that makes for a pretty limited offensive projection. his low pace approach doesn't really help matters in this regard either. perhaps can unlock more offensively if he picks up the pace and develops as a skater -- those two items sometimes go hand in hand. his stride is marred by a leap in his crossovers, a lack of ankle ﬂexion, and an inability to access his outside edges. that still leaves whichever team drafts with a pretty compelling player. he has the potential to be a nightmare for the opposition's best forwards on a night in, night out basis, and score a little secondary offence, too. every team could use centres like that in their lineup. in an overall difficult year for prospects, used the turmoil to his advantage. recognized as a high-end talent before the year began, he used every opportunity to his advantage to show why he is a legitimate top 20 talent in this year's draft. he helped to a silver medal at the world under-18's, producing 10 points in 7 games. is a well-balanced, highly skilled offensive talent. he can play all three forward positions and transitions with ease. he has excellent hockey sense and reads the play well in all zones. while he may not have a definitive “wow” factor, makes small plays with ease and makes those around him better. his skill-set translates incredibly well to the nhl level and will be a coach's dream thanks to his well-rounded, defensively conscience game. some scouts have some questions surrounding skating, but it is far from a liability. he could grow in strength, but that will come with age and continued physical maturity. overall, projects as a two-way middle-six forward at the nhl level. he is likely three years away from competing for an nhl roster spot. is the type of player who really excels at the fine details of the game. he's a reliable and consistent player, in all three zones and shift-in, shift-out. he looks very comfortable playing the position and understands the responsibilities of the role. even if he's not always successful with what he tries, with or without the puck, he's almost always in the place and applying the pressure. his defensive play is very advanced, breaking up plays and stealing pucks at an above-average rate, and he puts in a great effort in 50-50 battles. he shows great hustle in transition and a strong motor when pursuing puck carriers. he is very aggressive pressuring opponents and his strength on the puck is apparent in every defensive shift he takes. he doesn't shy away from physical play but makes good reads on when to finish a check on an opposing player or to make himself an open outlet along the side boards. he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, including driving to the opposing net. he's not a flashy dangler but he can comfortably control the puck, and there are times where he shows off some nice playmaking. he doesn't seem especially creative or crafty with the puck but he displays solid stickhandling ability. his biggest asset is the ability to draw pressure to himself before making a play, creating space for his linemates and causing confusion for opponents in cycle situations. shows no hesitation when firing from range, but seems to get his most threatening chances from inside the home plate area. is a powerful and deceptively fast skater, showing great extension in his strides and getting up to top speed quickly with strong crossovers and a wide base. while his agility and edgework at high speed still cause him some trouble when carrying the puck, uses his body to protect the puck very well. this is apparent in transition chances, when he regularly attempts to beat defenders wide with his reach and speed instead of attacking them head-on. his speed and agility aren't problems, though they could stand to improve, and on the plus side he still looks a little underdeveloped in terms of his lower-body strength, signalling room for improvement.\n",

' skating stands out as a quality, but it's how he uses it which has always drawn my attention and admiration. uses his speed to skate the puck out of high danger positions in the defensive zone. he also uses it to create space for himself to jump into the play quickly in transition or to move the puck up to a forward with ease. plays with a high degree of compete and pace. he is also physically mature for his age. some of ' biggest struggles this past season involved his defensive play, specifically gap control. some of this was likely a result of playing on a bigger ice service in but regardless, struggled at times to anticipate the speed and attacking ability of forwards, even in a lesser skilled league. defensemen can take a bit longer to develop, and has the tools to be a top-four defender at the nhl level. hopefully, next season will provide a better opportunity for him. he is likely three years away from nhl duty. it's tough to evaluate how is trending because he played one of the smaller sample sizes among the better prospects in this draft due to the delays and an injury, which eventually pulled him out of the league's regina hub. i liked what i saw of him at junior level, where he was dominant, but he only played a total of 14:22 in so there's not a lot to unravel there. was stellar for the ice a year ago and there's a lot to like (and very little to dislike) about his game. he's athletic, he's confident on the attack, he puts himself in a lot of transition sequences, he's sturdy in engagements, his point shot pops, and he's a heady playmaker who is capable of beating the first layer of pressure to make something happen. he doesn't have any one dynamic quality that mirrors the defencemen ranked in front of him but it's not hard to imagine him becoming a relied-upon all-situations defender. the risk, obviously, is that this year slows his trajectory. the offensive zone is where truly thrives. when is at the blue line in the offensive zone and has possession of the puck, you can expect strong lateral movements and crisp passing. if we focus on his lateral movements for a brief second, one of the qualities that i am fond of is ' “happy-feet”. for those who are unaware of what i mean by “happy-feet”, it is josh tessler lingo for a defenseman who deploys a rapid stride that allows him to go from side to side at a quick pace. with ' happy-feet, he can quickly skate along the blue line and find teammates to pass to even in traffic. can use his speed to dodge traffic, find an open lane, pass the puck or take a shot. in the defensive zone, he deploys tight pressure at the blue line and in his own slot. ' gap control is quite good as he can be tough to out-skate especially along the boards. the only challenge with his gap control that needs to be addressed is his ability to shut down top-notch stick-handlers. without question, didn't play as much as he would have liked this season, due to pandemic challenges and injury. still, the canadian defenseman was able to showcase some of his strengths in particularly with jyp's under-20 squad. gifted with great speed and mobility, he's difficult to corral or evade in all three zones. his shot from the point is impressive, and he's a strong, aggressive playmaker. a consistent physical presence, ' approach to the game is bold, and he's altogether a dependable defender. the move from winnipeg to tps' u20 roster hasn't done any favours for , whose draft stock has plummeted overseas. for about the final two months of last season, looked like a surefire top-10 pick. we're now at a point where it wouldn't surprise our staff to see him fall out of the first-round entirely. he's got a great shot, and we saw some really exceptional signs of point activation and puck support in the offensive zone from in the back-half of last season. we're still seeing the shot, but ' ability to find teammates from the point seems to be diminishing, and his skating remains a long-term concern. ' season didn't exactly go to plan. he started the year as someone with potential for the top-10 of this year's draft, and couldn't even manage to stop the slide in time to stick in the ﬁrst round by our ﬁnal ranking. with the on hold, he headed to there, he showed the same ﬂashes that made him so effective in the but without much improvement. he played just two games with winnipeg before having his season cut short due to a medical issue. is a potent shooter with the skill and instincts to manipulate defenders and improve his shooting location. with and without the puck, he activates from the point, becoming a passing option and a scoring threat. he fakes shots and passes, waits for the defender to commit, then bursts into the space he created. constant head fakes add another layer of deception. with hands in front, distance between his feet, and the top elbow elevated, drags the puck around defenders then ﬁres in one smooth motion. what separates him from other crafty point threats is ability to chain together these moves, like taking the puck in motion to draw the defender wide, hitting the brakes, faking a pass, stepping inside, then ﬁring a curl-and-drag wrister. in both the and ' offensive impact came and went. “he doesn't use his teammates other than to pretend to pass,” elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell wrote in a game report. “he leaves a tonne of value on the table by activating and then taking a shot with an easy-to-hit pass available.” nearly a year later, elite prospects dir. of european scouting lassi alanen expressed consistency concerns. “sometimes he's making proactive plays and activating a lot and then he just stands stationarily and ﬁres off a few wristers for the whole next period.” similar skill and inconsistency exists in ' transition game. just as he does from the point, he manipulates forecheckers and creates space, but suddenly a ﬂip switches and he's throwing away possession with clearances or no-chance passes for the rest of the game. some of his transition woes come from retrievals and decision-making under back pressure; he doesn't deceive or create an advantage for himself. the inconsistency, in part, comes from skating limitations. his posture is mostly too upright, lacking knee bend. his strides are too short with wide recoveries, limiting his push-off power. despite posture concerns, he could get to nhl average thanks to his backwards skating and crossovers. his puck-handling allows him to mitigate some skating concerns in small-area play, but he must develop his passing to consistently escape pressure at the next level. reports on ' defensive game are scattered, with some positive and many negative. here's a look at what ' defence looks like when he's locked in, as described by alanen: “he's always looking to kill off plays early, not giving any space for forwards before closing in on them, sometimes even before they've had time to cross the centerline. he's physically strong and can manhandle players at this level, sometimes with a little effort.” and when it's bad, illustrated by : “failing to scan, letting attackers slip behind him, and so much reaching.” might be the draft's biggest wildcard. if he expands upon his draft-minus-one season while improving the skating, he's back on track to become a no. 3 or even 2. if not, he's probably more of a bottom-pairing offensive specialist. has had a fairly up and down year, with more downs than ups as the season progressed. originally slated to play in the where he was dominant last season, played games in top junior league and struggled. when the season began, only played two games before a medical procedure shut down his season. what lands ' in my top 20 is his raw upside, even after a down-year.

            " is one of the best two-way forwards in the draft. his season started off with a great ivan hlinka, where he started off as a 50/50 guy to make it, but worked his way not only into a top role but was a top player at the tournament. he followed that up by being one of the better forwards on the top team in the his hockey iq is quite impressive. has the reliable defensive forward sense and work ethic off the puck where he makes good defensive plays and wins pucks, but he has great vision and composure with the puck as well. he can hold it for an extra second to make a play. has good hands and can make a skilled play to create space. also features a heavy shot and can finish chances well. the main issue in projecting him to the nhl is his feet. he really doesn't have an explosive element and can struggle to push defenders back off the rush, but he gets where he needs to by working hard. i've had a tough time truly buying into upside this year. he's a coach's dream in that he works extremely hard, he wins races and battles, he's responsible defensively and he nearly always makes the smart, safe play. but he's also more gifted than he plays; i would like to see him play a high-risk game. he has decent hands and impressive power to his game. i would just like to see him become more than a chip-and-chase cycle player. i suspect he'll become more of a complementary player at the nhl level than a primary option, but i think that could change if soo's standout core graduates and he is forced to try and play like he's the go-to guy. not flashy, just effective. is good at a lot of little detail things. it's why he was able to play a substantial role on one of the deepest and most talented teams in junior hockey this season. despite his youth, could be trusted to do pretty much whatever was needed of him. it speaks to how smart of a player he is and the kind of versatility he has. in some ways, it seems like the game slows down a bit for him and he's able to dictate. he doesn't have amazing puck skills, but he uses his frame well and seems to have a knack for where to be in all zones. is a fluid skater who has an efficient glide. he's not a burner by any means, but he gets up and down the ice well. he's a well-rounded who would be higher on this list if he had a little bit more of a dynamic element. improved speed and strength has been the noteworthy traits in his draft season. a quality release, good vision, quick hands, and can play centre or wing. is very well regarded in his own end. has flashed game-breaking stuff deep in the playoffs this spring. a safe player with a projectable future. a smart and calculated type of offensive presence, he can finish plays. not especially mobile or fast on his skates, but he's strong on the move and can find another gear when needed. not overly flashly, but he does own fancy puckmoving skills, which means he can quarterback the power play. he's deployed to work the slot with the man-advantage. also, he has an incredible ability to protect the puck and carry it through traffic. part of that is due to his high-end leg and core strength. he's more of a disher than a shooter, even though he has a lightningquick release. he's turned into a player that's very difficult to contain or predict. his work ethic, too, is noticeable. frequently, he wheels deep into his own zone to try to pry the puck away from attackers. at times, he can shy away from the physical stuff. he needs to add strength to be able to muscle opponents off the puck. scouts saw him, at times, fail to get inside position on attackers. defensive awareness is ok. he knows how to get into passing and shooting lanes to limit opponents. he has top-end hockey savvy, with great anticipation, especially in the offensive zone. tireless worker. expectations are for high output in 2018-19, which, according to some scouts, could translate into a nhl team's top-six sooner rather than later.\n",

            " simply put, has produced everywhere he has gone. in my opinion, he was the best player in the this season, and he has looked very good in international play for the past few seasons. is known mostly for his big-time shot, which makes him one of the more feared goal-scorers in this year's class. however, he is more than a shooter. has great hands, can make difficult feeds and can play at a quick pace, though he is most comfortable when winding up his cannon. he's small and not incredibly quick for a player his size (though i think his skating is adequate), but he's smart enough to put himself in position to score and has a little physical edge to his game too. he's committed to for 2017-18. some feel he is the most electric player in the past decade and is the purest shooter in the draft. despite the smaller stature, he isn't afraid to fight his way into scoring areas and release a wicked shot. he changes the angle on his release and draws opposition defenders near, thus opening passing lanes for teammates. throw in his elite speed and you've got a legit fantasy prospect. he will need to clean up the defensive side before locking down an nhl gig. is a naturally talented goal-scorer. he is a good skater who lacks in the top-end speed department but has elite acceleration and burst from a standing position. he works hard along the boards and knows how to protect himself from physical contact, while maintaining possession of the puck. he is dangerous with the puck in the offensive zone and has the awareness to find open space, giving himself enough time to get off a shot. shot is arguably his best offensive weapon. with an absolute rifle for a shot, very strong and accurate, he doesn't require much space to generate good power and accuracy. additionally, he displays great vision and passing ability, especially distributing the puck to the open option on the power play, and also on zone-entry attempts. is very smart around the net, constantly getting open, letting good shots go and anticipating any rebounds. he's a legitimate threat from the wing on the power play and possesses a good one-timer on cross-crease passes. remains a shoot-first player, a dangerous offensive catalyst, he has a great sense of where to be on the ice, with and without the puck. he loves to be in control of the puck and possesses a slick set of hands and shifty feet that allow him to fool the opposition in all areas of the ice. the weapons that has in is arsenal are astounding when it comes to playing inside the oppositions blue line. he has the impressive ability to move with a sense of quietness and stealth. he has the ability to slow the game down with his patience with the puck. offensive instincts and shooting abilities are elite. is gritty and aggressive for a smaller player, and isn't afraid to use his body to separate his man from the puck. smaller, not overly speedy wingers tend to have a difficult time making the nhl, but has so many other positive assets and a good energy that you can't help but root for him and have confidence he will make the nhl. he is a decent defensive player, and although engaged and positioned well in the defensive zone, he has shifts where he leaves the zone early and doesn't come far enough down the side boards to give his defenders an option for a breakout pass. his defensive game is still a work in progress as he has a tendency to float in the defensive zone when he's not engaged in the play. he has shown a tendency to be complacent and lazy when the bounces are not going his way.\n",

            " junior career has been bumpy to date due to multiple injuries the past two seasons, as he had hip surgery and tore a ligament in his thumb. when healthy, he's generally drawn praise from scouts, and he played well at the junior and international levels. is a very skilled and smart winger. he makes a lot of smart decisions and finds options consistently well. with hv71, was often used in their setups to make plays from behind the net, and he did so very well, finding players in high-percentage areas in a variety of ways. he has slippery skill, and while he won't often go end-to-end, he can get through defenders and have the odd impact shift with his skill. competes well. he's not overly physical, but he engages defenders well and will battle for space. his skating is fine. he can show the odd burst where he turns defenders, but his overall pace is average. good size and hockey sense have helped lift his draft stock throughout the season, as has a particularly strong performance at the under-18 world championship. he has a very good shot that he can get off from anywhere. the puck really zips off his stick. his puck skills are ok, and pretty average in terms of one-on-one stick skills, but he gets himself into good positions and helps create space for his linemates. has good physical strength which helps him protect the puck well, and he has a little power element to his game. but does he have enough skill to create on his own? a speedy forward with a lot of skill and creativity that makes him stand out on the ice. is an excellent skater with good first steps. he has elite acceleration and top speed and he can handle the puck and stickhandle his way through traffic while maintaining high speed. he also uses his soft hands to stickhandle his way past defenders. he has a strong wrist shot and can score from up close and from far out. he can play the game at both a high pace and a slow pace, sees the ice well and can make great plays on the power play where he mostly works from behind the net. he's a constant threat for his opponents to handle as he likes to challenge defenders on the outside and simply outskate them to force himself around them and towards the net. he's not a player waiting for something to happen and always tries to generate offense for his team and can create scoring chances on his own. however, he sometimes makes risky plays by doing too much on his own. he is an excellent forechecker and often can win puck battles in the defensive zone, too. he uses his speed to chase defenders and win pucks when they are trying to set up. overall, he's a very mobile player who likes to be involved in the game.\n",

            " is an interesting prospect. it seems to me that he is read-reliant now, but it will serve him well in adapting to higher levels of competition, as will his fairly precise positional adjustments and his comfort behind screens. he will have to work on his upper-body positioning to avoid being vulnerable to shooters that will beat him with quicker releases and sharper vertical angles on their shots than what has experienced up until now. as mentioned earlier, the biggest question about him is whether he has the top-end speed potential to make his strengths work at the highest professional levels. the standout takeaway about is that he lacks deficiencies in his there are quite a few things that are already built into his game at this young age. but there are not really any standout, or elite, abilities in the game either. that makes it hard to predict exactly where his can take him in the future. the foundation is there, but the question that lingers is where ’s ceiling is. he is, at the moment, a jack of all trades, but can he turn into a king along the way?\n",

            " was one of the better freshmen in the country this season, as he served as a key puck-moving defenseman for his team and played a lesser role for the americans at the wjc. he put up some huge point totals for a freshman, but a fair amount of that was buoyed by secondary assists. is an offensive defenseman at heart, and he excels when he has the puck on his stick. he skates very well and shows a lot of ability to evade pressure and lead a rush. he's a pretty effective power-play quarterback, with above-average or better hands and vision. defensively, he'll have good and bad days. he's not spectacular at checking good players or playing the body with force, and he is prone to brain cramps in his positioning and decision-making. he won't be leaned on as the first guy over the boards to kill a penalty, but it's very possible he could skate top-four minutes at his peak. is a high-upside defenseman who primarily plays an offensive game. he is very strong on the puck. the main thing that leads to his puck-possession success is that he keeps his feet moving through contact. he shows off his slick hands and ability to deke through a few defenders and keep the puck. he has quick decision-making ability both with and without the puck. often catches the defense off-guard because he makes quick plays with the puck, as if he knows what he is going to do with the puck before he even gets it. he is able to do everything at high speed, such as dishing a crisp pass without having to slow down to process his options, hitting the open man through a seam in traffc. he is constantly making solid defensive plays, using his reach and his strength to get to the man and separate him from the puck. his gap control is strong and he quickly steps up to eliminate a passing option, play the puck or completely play his man to the outside and out of harm's way. he is a forward-thinker who sees the ice well and analyzes the game exceptionally well. sees lanes develop, and if he doesn't like his options, he moves quickly to get a different angle and distribute. he is a smooth skater, making it look effortless at times. quick mobility and agility allow him to pounce on his man or get up ice in a hurry. exudes confdence and is strong with the puck, not allowing others to get after it. controlled movements and smooth mobility make him highly effective in possession. he is deadly in transition as he makes on-the-money passes to options who will kickstart the rush. has a nice gear he can tap into, and uses it wisely and effectively. defensively, he smartly uses body positioning to angle off forwards and prevent any big plays in one-on-one rush situations. has the ability to also play the body and will line up a hit if the opportunity is there. he will also use his strength to push his man out of the crease area or to wage battle along the wall. is a guy who really does not have an elite trait about him—except maybe his skating. his passing game is on-point and his awareness is solid, but he really does not have that one area that defnes him as a player. he can, at times, over-handle the puck and run out of options, being overly patient with the puck. will also want to focus on being more defensive-minded and not always jump into the rush, and make better reads on when to do so. he needs to bring the same consistent effort to the defensive side of the game as he does to his puck-moving and offensive game.\n",

            " the well-rounded was the top player on the inaugural under-18 team this season, and showed well in international play. offensively, he has the traits one would expect of a top prospect. he's an above-average skater, with a good first step and an easy stride. his skills aren't elite, but he shows good hands and is able to create space for himself. his hockey iq is very impressive, as he displays great patience with the puck, sees his options well and always finds himself involved with the play. is a fierce competitor in puck battles and, despite having a lean frame, is able to win a fair amount of them. he's also a quality defensive who has been leaned on all season in critical defensive situations, and is often a threat to score shorthanded. though he and the rest of his teammates were disqualified from the under-18 world championships, it's hard to see his draft stock slipping too much. is a highly intelligent contributor all over the ice. he is a game-changer and a highly competitive kid. he can be a dominant puck-possession guy, a strong puck-distributor, a fnisher, a defensive specialist and even a pest at times. he has strong skating ability, as he is fast and agile; he uses his skating on both sides of the puck. the plays a complete game and commits defensively, getting back and being hard on his man at all costs. gets back with speed and can break up plays unexpectedly from behind with a quick stick lift and puck scoop. he continuously makes great defensive plays before turning back up ice. seems to always be on the puck, and when he is not, he is relentless in getting on it. he pounces on opportunities, taking advantage of loose pucks and time and space, and has an impressive ability to create something out of absolutely nothing. he is strong on the puck and possesses unexpected soft hands in tight. uses his size and strength to protect the puck and fend off incoming checks all while maintaining possession and getting himself in position to try a shot or pass. he uses his long reach to his advantage to break up plays as well as pull the puck back in tight to his body and away from opposing players; he also uses it to keep the puck a distance from the check, increasing his ability to protect it in open ice. has deceptive speed and is quite shifty while moving full steam ahead, making excellent use of his edges to move laterally. he possesses incredible hockey sense, reading the play well and adapting accordingly, showing no quit in his game. picks his spots very well and has a high-velocity shot that he can get off as he moves toward the net, keeping the puck away from his body just enough to unload. he has a creative mind, and can fnd his man in traffc with crisp tape-to-tape passes. on-ice vision, awareness of the game and work ethic are probably his biggest strengths. it's kind of nit-picking a little as is such a hard-working guy and tries to do everything well, but he will need some coaching and strength work on his faceoff ability. he does get involved in physical battles, but not consistently as sometimes he would rather use his stick than fnish a hit along the boards. would be better served to bring the physical element more consistently as he is a force when he is using his body and playing with an edge.\n"
