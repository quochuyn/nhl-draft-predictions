            "corpus first 5: [\" has all the assets you're looking for in a top nhl forward. he's a 6-foot-4 winger who can beat opponents with speed and skill. he possesses outstanding puck skills and can put pucks through legs and sticks at a very high rate. can use finesse, or power and quickness to get around defenders. can also set up and finish plays well. physically, he won't run over guys but his compete is good enough. he projects as a top-line winger with the potential to pop and become a true star in the nhl. is one of the draft's most tantalizing prospects, with a skill-size combo that scouts and coaches clamour for and he has already demonstrated against pro competition domestically and, more notably, internationally. it has been a big year for him. nine points in five games and a historic silver medal for the slovaks at the hlinka gretzky cup. an olympic bronze medal as the tournament's mvp. a silver medal with his club team, tps. a team-leading nine points at the men's worlds. is built like a power forward, with a 218-pound frame that makes him one of the draft's heaviest players, but he plays the game with uncharacteristic finesse, regularly flashing hands you'd expect out of a smaller player one-on-one to pull pucks in tight to his feet. he's also got a rangy, fluid stride, which makes him a surprisingly dangerous rush player — and impressive confidence with the puck on his stick, which enables him to hang onto it (sometimes to a fault) and attack off the wall into the slot (he loves taking the puck from the half wall to the home plate area to shoot from his forehand. the team that drafts him will be betting on his upside, which grades at or near the very top of this class. i'm also a big fan of his approach. he has continued to play his style and look to attack in control (a lot of forwards his size become more deferential and fall back into give-and-go habits to fit a mould when they make the jump to the pro level) as he has played against higher and higher competition. there is, despite his makeup and success, some risk associated with his projection at his size (small players aren't the only ones who carry size-based limitations with them!) though, and that, combined with how much i like the four players i have slotted ahead of him here, does leave me a little lower on him than where he'll be picked, even if there's a real chance he becomes one of the two or three best players out of this draft. can be a menace at the nhl level. his stick-handling reach and his play on the cycle makes him a threat down low. if he can broaden his game by working on his long range shot, that allows him to become a dual threat. but, even if he doesn't become that dual threat offensively, he has the physicality and the reach to net pucks in puck battles and set up teammates in the slot. with that said, i can envision him being a top six contributor at the nhl level. the potential of what can be as he continues on in his is intoxicating. a 6-foot-4 winger with physicality, high-end skill and one of the better overall shots in this draft, it's hard not to get excited. there is a chance that he ends up being the no. 1 pick in this draft and may one day be viewed as its best player. he's every bit as good as the other two players listed ahead of him on talent alone. i've watched a lot this year and while i am enamored with the physical tools and skills, there's not a ton of precedent for the kind of season he had, where he produced at a rate far below expectations of a top-five nhl draft pick in his league season yet was off the charts internationally. in the end, the largest sample we have to judge is that from his club season with tps. you look at players from the that have gone early in drafts and all of them had better numbers than , and many of them had better numbers by a lot. it's not something that is easily ignored. among u18 players who have played at least 20 games in the as u18 players, 0.32 points per game ranks 35th and 21st overall in the last 10 years. is a classic eye-test darling and that's a big reason why i have him in this range. if he hadn't played so well in those international events, i'm not sure we're having this discussion at all. but he did play in those games and we got to see a physically dominant young player who held his own against pros and eventually became one of his team's most important players. the olympics and world championship fields were not nhl-caliber competition, but they were significant stages on which broke out against professionals. i also think his progression over the season and playing with confidence down the stretch significantly altered how well he played for the better. this is a tough case to read, because we have a body of work that suggests he's statistically not among top-tier players in his own league historically, but we have this immense skillset that is so unique in this draft class that it's impossible to overlook. i think is in the mix with cooley and wright to be the best players in this class, and even though i know what the numbers say, i can't get past the incredible ceiling i believe his size-and-skill package creates. is one of the largest players in the first round and also possesses the largest upside of anyone in the class. a rocket of a shot, soft hands, and an improving skating stride all packaged into a 6-foot-4, 220-pound frame. his ability to make plays in space is great, but he'll need to do it without that time as well. he could be a unicorn. nothing brought out draft year best quite like the opportunity to wear his country's colours and represent in international competition. he's the ultimate patriot. started the scouting season off as if shot from a cannon, putting up nine points in five games en route to a silver medal at the hlinka-gretzky in august. next up, seven goals in seven games and mvp honours as he led to the bronze medal at the beijing olympics. then, lastly, a point a game clip at the world hockey championships in all this in his age-17 season. it's not like he was chopped liver in the either. ten points in 31 games is hardly anything to scoff at from a first-time draft-eligible skater in one of europe's more challenging professional leagues, after all. the appeal with is obvious: he's a 6-foot-4 playmaking power forward with soft hands, shooting skill, and the sort of wall game that would already rate as an above-average quality in the nhl. the first thing you notice is just how easily he retains possession under duress. it's like watching a bully play keep away, one hand stiff-arming his victim out of reach and the other one waving their stolen item to mock them for good measure. if wants the puck, then he takes the puck, and good luck getting it back. that we've mostly seen this from the slovak winger in professional settings this season just makes it that much more impressive. it's one thing to ward off physically undeveloped 17-year-olds in the whl; it's another thing entirely to swat away seasoned veterans in top men's league like they're mosquitos. brings a lot more to the table than just brute force, though. what makes him a unique prospect is how he turns those extended possession sequences into legitimate scoring chances. sometimes, it's a drive to the net-front for a chance of his own; other times, he'll handle his way into a passing opportunity and send the puck to his linemate to finish the job. where often leaves our staff wanting, though, is with his footspeed. the deficiencies are many, whether it's his posture, a heel kick out of recoveries, or a hop in his crossovers. he just cannot separate from opponents in space. to credit, we've already seen considerable growth from him as a skater this season, and there isn't any reason to believe he won't continue on that path as he rises up the ranks. it's probably an about-average tool at this point, which is a pretty big step up on where he started the season. don't be surprised if you hear name called as high as first overall in july's draft. players with his skill set are so rare. teams guard these players closely when they have them, and they move heaven and earth to find one when they don't. i mean, who wouldn't want a high-scoring top-six winger with a physical side? that's the upside with . dominated the international scene this past season, solidifying himself as my number two pick in the nhl draft this season. over the last year, played at the world juniors, the olympics, and world championships. his most dominating performance came at the olympics, where he led to a bronze medal and received mvp honors, a remarkable feat for an 18-year-old. is an intriguing prospect with an absurd overall physical and offensive package. at 6'4 and well over 200 pounds, is strong on the puck and uses his frame in a physical manner. yet, he has incredible hands and can make plays in-tight like few players can in this draft class. this is what makes so unique. he's a player with size and high skill that can dominate down-low or in open ice. while he dominated at the international level against men, struggled to put up points at times in top league. however, scouts aren't too concerned and believe higher numbers will come with time. may make the jump to the nhl immediately next season due to his physical maturity but will likely need at least another season of to further his offensive game. drives offense from the wing. he's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. he can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size. using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. while he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. with strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. on-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. he also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. he has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. his unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the nhl level. he is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. if he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt will be a force at the nhl for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. if he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly.\", \" is a very well-rounded who has no noticeable flaw in his skill set but there also isn't a ton about his game that gets you overly excited. he can skate and handle the puck like an nhler. game translates because of his compete and direct style of play. he takes pucks to the net and plays quick. he can pull up to make a tough pass but can take pucks to the interior too. he has the high-end vision to run a power-play unit and make tough plays with pace. his shot is very good, showing the ability to pick corners from long range consistently. off the puck he's competitive and responsible, showing maturity beyond his years. he projects as a no. 1 in the nhl due to his all-around play with a chance to be a star, but probably won't be an elite scorer in the league. still my top prospect in this class (though no longer in a tier of his own), is an athletic kid who boasts a wide gait and boxy shoulders that balance him over pucks. those physical tools are complemented by a lethal wrist shot release (which he can get off from several stances and pops off of his blade's heel or toe) and quick hands in traffic that allow him to take pucks off of the wall and create scoring chances to the interior. he's also one of the most diligent three-zone players in the draft, with a powerful stride that helps him push play up ice (though its power is more evident the length of the sheet than from a standstill into a quick foot race) when he's done providing support low in his zone or above the puck. while his shot is his biggest weapon inside the offensive zone (i actually think he was owed a few more goals than his 35 on 290 shots this season gave him), he played a much more creative game inside the offensive zone into the second half. he blends versatile skill with a heady, detailed game that will allow him to drive a line and be relied upon in all situations down the middle at the next level. there are times when scouts want to see him play with a little more fire and feistiness to really take over games and impose himself on the forecheck/in battles more, but his eye for detail off the puck puts him in a supportive role more often than an active chase and that's fine. i would have liked to see him hang onto the puck a little more this season, but he played with talented linemates where his ability to play into their strengths and execute off of give-and-go's worked. he's got pro tools and projects as an impactful top-six centre. he may not become a point per game player, but i see 30-goal, 70-point upside at a premium position. the complicated and essential question to answer is, “what does this all mean looking forward?” there is no doubt that attention to detail style of play combined with intelligent and quick decision-making is the start of a valuable foundation for him to continue to build on as he progresses into the nhl. however, that package of skills and habits will only take him so far when he advances to play against more intelligent and faster competition. in the he infrequently shows off his high octane offense, which reasonably has caused doubts about his offensive ceiling. at this moment in time, it is likely premature to value these concerns heavily enough to knock him off the top spot in the 2022 draft class. however, if these question marks around his offensive contributions still exist in july, it would be warranted to consider how his game will project to the nhl and if that assessment leads to a consensus 1st overall player. the expectation for (or any prospect for that matter) should not be to save the franchise or to be a generational talent, as he will most likely disappoint. a reasonable projection for would be in the range of a low-end 1st line to a high-end 2nd line which to some may sound pessimistic in the context of 1st overall. still, it is an essential piece to have on a successful team and is not easy to acquire. in addition, will likely benefit from being paired with skilled wingers, who can allow to focus on pushing play up ice to the offensive zone where his linemates can flourish. finally, with his shot, he will surely be a continual threat on the powerplay, where he has consistently shown he can score from many angles and distances. with high-end hockey sense highlighted by his tremendous offensive intelligence, can make a lot of plays. while he lacks a dynamic puck skills in terms of handling, he has one of the better shots in this draft class with a quick, deceptive release. though he has often been compared to patrice bergeron, i think is a good two-way player but not to the degree where that is an especially apt comparison. he does a lot of the things you hope a does in terms of puck possession, making plays and contributing in his own end. the offensive elements of his game are the standout traits for me. my biggest concern with to date is the general lack of progression in his game year over year, with the full knowledge that he missed an entire season. while i think he should be graded on a curve as a result, it is harder to know just how much that lost season impacted his long-term projection. hockey sense is a separating factor from most of his peers and he clearly has that competitive drive that allow him to win a lot of battles. in the end, i think does just about everything well. his hockey sense and his shot are high-end-to-elite traits, he has terrific vision and spots plays with the best of them, but the lack of a dynamic element to his play is what gives me the most concern aside from his progression. i have been waiting all season to see a player who looks like he should be a no. 1 nhl draft pick, and i did not feel his ceiling is at the same level as slafkovsky's or cooley's. is the safer pick of all three in that i think he has the highest floor of any of those three players and possesses an nhl-ready game. i don't think he's done developing and there's plenty of potential for him to still reach for, but my concern is that he's closer to plateauing than the other two players. i'm not convinced that's true yet, but it's definitely in the back of my mind as i rank these players because, to me, all three are very close. the top player from the class held this position from tip to tail on my board. is a highly intelligent pivot who boasts a heavy release, deft passing touch, and the wherewithal to package those tools into their situations. he lacks the separation speed you'd like from an elite centre but makes up for it with his nuanced understanding of the game. can connect plays, drive action, dish it or finish it, and thwart plays against. he's going to be good. in a draft year shaped by substantial depth rather than overwhelming star power, it's almost fitting that the least exciting option at first overall is the one. better still, the one, if you'll allow us that clunky pun. that would end up in that spot may have seemed like a foregone conclusion a year or two ago, but the gap year that the lost 2020-21 season forced on (and countless others) him slow out of the gates. two months of good-not-great production was enough to make the question of the first overall pick an open one for many in the industry, with new answers emerging first in the form of logan cooley and then later in juraj slafkovsky. in time, though, reminded the scouting community of his quality, ending many (not all…) of those conversa-tions emphatically. the 1.15 point per game clip that he ran through october and november turned to 1.36 by the end of the calendar year. from there, it just kept climbing until had amassed 94 points in 63 regular season contests by the season's end, good for a 1.49 point per game clip. it's still the lowest draft year points per game mark of any first overall pick out of the this side of rick nash in 2001, but a more selective and perhaps representative sample from december onward gets to 1.63 points per game. that's more than nico hischier in 2017 and ryan nugent-hopkins in 2011, for context. shifting our focus from the question of how many to how, is this draft's premier play-connector; an on-ice ad-ministrator through which his team's offensive and defensive sequences flow. by constantly surveying the ice, maintains a mental map of his surroundings with a downright topographical level of detail. he knows the position of his teammates like they're a long-established fact rather than a dynamic, changing set of options on the playing field, and moves the puck to them with a matching level of confidence. look-off passes, the give-and-go, one- and two-touch passes, reach-adjusted passing -- mastered every one of these tools en route to becoming one of the game's best playmaking centres not currently in the nhl. his cunning as a distributor with a high-level shot (even if it's a little peculiar from a mechanical perspective) that's especially potent off of the pass and some of the best hands in the class. he's the complete package offensively. we would, of course, feel better about shot if he used it a little more judiciously rather than settling for low percentage attempts under pressure, but that's a minor quibble for as scalable an offensive toolkit as you'll find in this class. then there's his play in the defensive zone. de-fensive reads, angles, and support play are beyond reproach. there may not be an art ross in his future, but the frank j. selke seems well within reach. we don't make the patrice bergeron comparison lightly, after all. all of these factors combined to make the consensus first overall pick for the elite prospects scouting staff. you just don't come across many players this polished or this well-rounded at 18-years-old, and that's too much to pass up on if you're holding the first pick in this july's draft. has been on the radar of scouts for a long-time now. he received exceptional status to play in the as a 15-year-old and put up amazing numbers at the time. unfortunately, he did not play last season because of covid restrictions in ontario. despite the missed time, captained to an under-18 gold medal in 2021 and put up 94 points this season. is potentially the most well-rounded player in the draft. he does everything really well, in all zones. he plays a mature game and has strong leadership qualities. originally looked like more of a goal-scorer in his 15-year-old season, but he has rounded out his playmaking as well in the past year or so. he finished top 10 in scoring. biggest asset is his shot and his ability to generate scoring opportunities. he can drive a line on his own, making him a potential number one at the nhl level. some scouts question his offensive ceiling for a potential number one pick, but he could easily put up 30 goals and 70 points at the nhl level with regularity. should jump into full-time nhl duty next season. is an elite two-way with incredible offensive ability. it's not often you watch players where you really struggle to find too many weaknesses at this level, but he has been that way for a while now. his intelligence on the ice is second-to-none and on full display in his playmaking, his lane pursuit, and his awareness. adds a pro caliber shot to his toolbox that will allow him to be a multi-dimensional offensive threat at the nhl level, sooner rather than later. he's so mature in his defensive game and because of that, he is just as effective defensively as he is offensively. he knows the nuances of playing the position and can properly support his defenders on every play. he never seems to be caught out of position and remains engaged and effective on both the rush and the cycle. the biggest issue with game this season was his inconsistent offensive production. through the christmas break, he wasn't producing the way a top-tier draft eligible prospect would in the but he put most of the questions about his production to rest with his amazing second-half explosion. there was an odd amount of discourse surrounding stature as the top player in this class given the way his season went. while it wasn't completely unwarranted, it is important to remember he missed essentially the entire 2020-21 season due to the pandemic, and had insane expectations coming off his rookie season. the way rebounded in the latter half of the year showed enough to remind people why he can be a future top-line in the nhl for years to come and why he is considered the odds-on favorite to be the number one selection in the nhl draft.\", \" is a dynamic player. when he has the puck on his stick you instantly notice him because of his high-end speed, skill and offensive iq. he can make highly creative dekes and passes at full speed. the pace of his game is why i think he will be a top nhl player. he takes pucks up the ice and to the net often. lacks size, but he plays hard. he can drive play at even strength while also having the vision and shot to be a power-play threat running a unit from the walls. he projects as a first-line forward; as a he would be a low-end first-line in the nhl. is a beautiful, flowing skater capable of beating defenders off the mark, circling the zone to get defenders watching him with the puck, and manipulate them with his footwork and maneuverability in tight spaces. he's got an uncanny ability to side-step and hop around oncoming players at speed. he's got a great sixth sense for timing and spacing around the offensive zone which frees him to accept passes or jumps him onto rebounds. he regularly flashes skill to the inside, slicing to the middle and pulling pucks through or around defenders. he's also a swiss army knife player who combines nhl speed and skill with a working attitude to push the pace, make plays, win races, stay involved, and get onto the ice in all situations. i love his tempo and feel for the game out there. his touch with the puck and hands both get high grades, his skating (particularly his change of pace) and energy level are both differentiators, and those things make for a pretty compelling package. you won't find a scout who doesn't like him, either. the transition game into the offensive zone. the vision off the wall. he can play interior or exterior. he's incredibly crafty in control. he can stickhandle in a phone booth. he creates problems for defencemen attacking on angles and shifting at speed. he also has a scrappiness to his game that keeps him in the fight. is for sure one of the more well-rounded and talented players in the entire 2022 draft class. he certainly projects as a top-6 forward, who could play anywhere in the lineup and be able to contribute without question. based off his play to start the season, it wouldn't come as a shock to see name come off the draft board within the first 5 picks, possibly even inside the top 3. plenty of teams will fawn over his abilities and depending on the situation he's drafted into, that team may be able to sway his decision to forego the next season, and head straight to the nhl. over the last several months, i have constantly debated who was no. 1. i had at no. 1 at the mid-term and i waffled over the next few months when wright started picking up his play. that also coincided with dipping in production and playing a more complicated game than he needed to. but the reasons i had no. 1 then are the reasons i have him there now. this is not a great draft at the top, but he's this draft's most dynamic player with the greatest potential for explosive offense. with high-end speed and the ability to make high-level plays on the rush, he does things most players in this class cannot. while he played with a brilliant supporting class at the this year – as you'll see down this list at the number of u.s. u18s in the first-round range – was always heads above the rest in terms of the plays he could create and the way he dictated shifts throughout the season. i believe he can be a no. 1 at the next level if he continues on his current trend line. he competes on every inch of the ice and can play a strong north-south game despite his ability to stretch defenses with his east-west skill. as i've watched the playoffs this year, my thinking shifted even more. the best teams have fast, dynamic forwards that are constantly keeping defenders on their heels. they don't cede possession without trying all of their other options. processes the game as fast as anyone in this draft and his ability to spot plays in transition is a major separator from the field. he has vision, threads passes well and can get behind defenders to give himself better looks at the net. is headed to the university of next year, which has been a solid training ground the last few years for players on the nhl track. i think he's probably a one-and-done in player and would be ready to make an nhl impact by 2023-24. in the end it's not about when he arrives, but how he progresses. i think he has the highest ceiling of any of the top three nhl prospects and plays the style most consistent with the modern nhl's. speed is a premium and he brings it in spades, with the ability to finish plays as well as anyone else in this class. if everything goes for him, and that's always a big if with any player's i think could be a superstar in the league. a highly creative, speed-driven pivot who brings a lot of pop down the middle. really showed his ability to activate and make plays off of the rush this season. very exciting hands to go with the quick feet. should be able to play a comprehensive, all-situations role in a few years. you won't find a more singularly-gifted puckhandler in this year's draft than . he's a human highlight-reel, swashbuckling his way through defenders like a hot knife cuts through butter. it all starts with the first touch, and has the best one in this class. the way he seamlessly blends pass recep-tions at speed into his first move without breaking stride is almost unfair. whether it's catching a difficult pass on the backhand, forehand, or inside a crossover -- making it happen. it's like watching a wide receiver with an unlimited catch radius. the way keeps his top hand pushed out from his body as a handler for the full range of motion, changes speeds and lanes through the neutral zone, and deceives with shoulder feints and look-offs -- this is pro-level stuff. you can rest assured that this part of his game is going to scale up to the nhl in at least some capacity. more than just an and1 mixtape on skates, though. he's one of the rare triple-threat scorers in this draft. all of those moves serve a purpose, whether it's drawing in defenders to create space elsewhere, opening up passing lanes, or getting into better shooting positions. think of it as controlled chaos. there -- the vision and anticipation to see developing plays, the cunning and deception to make them more easily attain-able, and the touch as a distributor to connect. our only real concern with projection is the ab-sence of any high-end tools outside of his skill as a handler. even then, tendency to play beyond his considerable skill level often turns his greatest asset into a liability. there were just far too many turnovers and low percentage plays in his draft year for our liking. on the one hand, you want to see a gifted player like test the limits of their game every time he takes the ice; on the other, a little discretion would go a long way. where managed to allay our concerns on that front was with his growth this season as an off-the-puck scoring threat. it showed our staff that there was a way for him to stay involved in his team's offence even when he's not driving play personally. the proof of concept that he can produce in a more selfless fashion. supports the play well, consistently displays an understanding of the rotation habits of everyone on the ice, perfectly times his movements into space, and prepares his body and footwork to send one- and two-touch attempts on goal as the puck finds him. still, it wouldn't hurt to add another gear as a skater. he's a bit top-heavy, lacks explosive lateral mobility, and sometimes struggles to access his outside edges. he's about an nhl average skater as currently constructed, and it's definitely a part of his game that could stand to improve. overall, though, there's no disputing no. 1 centre upside, even if it's hardly a foregone conclusion that he gets there at the height of his career. just having that within his range of realistic outcomes counts for a lot. a small, speedy dominated the and solidified himself in my top five as the season progressed. consistently took over games using his excellent speed and instincts. more of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, can drive a line on his own. he can run a powerplay and isn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to make a play. he is also a relentless forechecker and possession driver. plays with high tempo and energy. not only is he a great skater, but he is also incredibly agile and uses this ability to elude defenders. he is also excellent defensively and is rarely a liability in his own zone. makes excellent transition plays and finds ways to utilize all his teammates on a regular basis. he has shown he can drive a line and there is a dynamic quality to his game. is a likely top-five pick and could go as high as number two. he is slated to attend the university of next season. is likely one year away from nhl duty. juraj slafkovsky drives offense from the wing. he's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. he can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size. using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. while he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. with strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. on-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. he also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. he has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. his unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the nhl level. he is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. if he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt slafkovsky will be a force at the nhl for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. if he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly.\", \" is a very talented scorer. he stands out with the puck on his stick and can attack in a variety of ways. is an excellent passer, who can run a power play, hit seams at a high rate and make tough plays under duress. he has very good hands to maneuver in traffic. he has good speed to beat opponents wide and he has a shot that can score from range. lacks ideal nhl size, but he competes hard and wins a surprising amount of battles for his size. he doesn't have incredible speed and skill for a 5-foot-9 player so he may be moved to the wing in the nhl, but regardless i see him as a very good top-six forward. there isn't a player in this draft class whose game thrills more than does when he's firing. inside the offensive zone, he's lethal. he's got extremely quick side-to-side hands that help him beat defenders one-on-one off of cuts. he's got an nhl shot (which he can place with pinpoint accuracy from a bad angle and rip by a goalie clean from a distance, but he also loves to change up and slide five-hole). he does an excellent job creating plays to the slot out of traffic. he's a burning skater with explosiveness that allows him to win races, separate in transition, and put defenders onto their heels, or dash through holes in coverage to the net (or draw a penalty). he's a soft small-area passer who blends deception into his movements. and then on top of those things, he's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder. he's always engaged, he keeps his feet moving, he plays with a ton of energy, and he finishes all of his checks and knocks his fair share of players over despite being on the smaller side). he's also sturdier on his feet than his frame might suggest, which helps him play between checks. i see a dynamic, high-tempo, top-six, goal-creating package. he's an exciting talent in a draft that's short on them, with clear pp1 upside due to his shooting-skill package and clear five-on-five upside because of his skating and motor. even in games where the points don't fall, he's almost always dangerous and threatening on the ice — and he's seldom going to leave you wanting more. after suffering a shoulder injury in the playoffs, is also now out of his sling, which is positive news for the summer ahead. has star potential at the nhl level, especially if he can continue on the developmental track that he is currently on. i've talked about deceptiveness and ability to manipulate defenses, and that will lead him to nhl success. has the potential to dazzle audiences on a nightly basis with his outstanding hockey sense, pace, and puck handling skills. could easily put up 50 assists in a season on a regular basis in his prime given how well he sees the ice and how easily he can find teammates with his passes. i'd argue that 70+ point seasons are well within the realm of possibility for if he can continue along this path. after watching closely for a while now, i feel that it's safe to say that he has a high probability of nhl success. will be able to keep pace on any line and slow down or speed up his game to adjust to the play style of his linemates. his timing on passes and positioning makes him one of the stronger offensive players in this draft class and a potent scorer and playmaker whenever he's on the ice. some of my biggest questions with game involve how he'll adjust to the nhl. hasn't faced the strongest competition at times this season, and i feel that he can be a little inconsistent against the better teams. typically, those are the teams that give him less space to work with, so i'm curious to see how is able to adapt. he won't be given a lot of time or space to work with in the nhl, so he'll have to rely on his quick decision making and hockey sense in order to create high danger chances. another question i have is whether or not can take his game from great to elite. there's no argument in my mind that has looked great for the vast majority of the season. i've seen flashes of elite play, but not on a consistent enough basis for me to believe that he could be a top ten, maybe even top five, in the nhl. now, is playing like a potential top ten pick with the potential to put up 50, perhaps even 60 points at the nhl level. i've seen a much higher gear to his game where he looks flat out dominant and a player capable of becoming a 70, even 80-point player at the nhl level. that's when he looks like a true second overall pick that could contend for the first overall spot. now, however, i'm waiting on to play at an elite level consistently. obviously, teams will worry about size and average defensive play. i don't see it as an issue moving forward. is a deceptive skater and can avoid physical contact in all three zones, and his defensive play isn't bad for a player his size. a player's size doesn't determine a player's skill level, so passing on would be a huge mistake. teams passing on a potential franchise cornerstone would be a bold strategy, and not one i'd recommend. top centers, especially handed ones, don't come around every day. at the end of the day, it's going to come down to how is developed and how he handles the transition to the pros. i believe that he can play in the nhl as early as next season given his dynamic nature in the offensive zone and adequate defensive zone play. should be able to thrive in the modern nhl thanks to his speed and creativity. the inaugural and totally real dwayne “the rock” johnson “most electrifying player” award goes to for his exciting play. game is all about drive, it's about power. he stays hungry and he devours the competition. i'm not sure about samoan in his veins, but i do know this: he's a damn good prospect and someone i'd be clamoring to draft if i were a team with a lottery pick. a top-10 scorer in the this season, did nothing to dissuade anyone on his offensive talent. if there's one thing i thought was even better this season for , it's that he just battles. he didn't play like a 5-foot-9 player. there's an aggressiveness and a desire to physically engage with the opposition. he's going to have to get stronger to be more effective at that, but most of his other tools are high end. he's a good skater with quick hands and an ability to drive the net. his ability to distribute pucks quickly, accurately and decisively makes him stand out in the playmaking department. the size is a factor in terms of if he can play at the top level or not and that may ultimately skew his projection, but it's hard to ignore the total skills he has. it's also hard to argue with 90 points in 65 games. this is a very competitive range of the draft, which is why it's tougher to project against some of the others. a point-producing machine in the this past season, leans on his skating, deft passing skills, and offensive mind. his reliance on the man-advantage was well documented, but he did lead all 2022-eligible skaters in primary, even-strength points-per-game. the inability to get the inside, coupled with his stature and just average iq is what keeps him a bit lower than his pure skill and stats would indicate. few players in the 2022 nhl draft have spent more time in the scouting community's sights than winnipeg ice winger . a rejected bid for exceptional status, the first overall pick in the draft, a trip to the during the pandemic year, and back to a 90-point season with the best regular season side... he's done his part to command their attention. game is one of pure, unrelenting skill. he's built to score, whether that's depositing the puck in the back of the net himself or setting his teammate up for the honour. the result of this skill last season was a 1.38 point per game clip, good for the highest rate among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the all of his scoring tools rate as above-average, but the foun-dation on which his game rests is his skating stride. heavy crossover use and constant motion propel his high-pace, constantly attacking approach, making his every puck touch an opportunity to create a scoring chance. then stacks a brilliant first touch, handling skill, an in-stride wrister, and one- and two-touch passing ability on top of that skating and pace combo to ensure many of those chances aren't for naught. having the runway to take advantage of those tools helps, but proven a pretty robust off-puck scoring threat during sustained offensive zone sequences, too. his willing-ness to get inside and play between checks allows him to seek out soft ice, and his finishing skill takes over from there. of course, if one were to nitpick, they would point out that it took until about the midway point in the season for to consistently display any of these tools in a meaningful fashion. even then, this year's tape represented a bit of a letdown relative to the lofty standards his draft-minus-one film with the dubuque fighting saints established. look through his game reports, and you'll find that he went from a can't-miss top-five player to one barely clinging to the back end of our top-10. and of all the alarming trends to reveal themselves from draft year, his deference was probably the one that most concerned our staff. he was, frankly, gun shy at times, it seemed. he would often panic under pressure where others would attract opponents to create space elsewhere. simply put: didn't create advantages for his team the way that a prospect with top-line nhl aspirations should at this stage in their however, the tools remain exceptional, and we saw enough flashes of high-level thinking to still feel confident with in the back half of the top 10 in this year's draft. to see him halve that number with his actual draft position wouldn't surprise us either. it's just that we've come to see him as more of a top-six prospect than a top-line one, and the result is his no. 10 billing in the elite prospects 2022 nhl draft guide. i've been high on all season and my impressions of him have not changed. a small, diminutive is a well-rounded offensive-minded player. he plays with high pace and tenacity as well, making him a formidable opponent. last season, dominated the and this season, he put up 90 points in the showing an ability to put up points at high levels of competition. has a reputation for anticipating the play well and making plays at top speed with ease. uses his edges well in-tight. he projects more as a playmaker at the nhl level and can be used in all offensive situations. he appears to have the ability to drive a line and make those around him better. biggest question mark is his size. there are few nhl centers below 5'11. however, his skill and speed significantly make up for his lack of height. he is also strong on his skates and has excellent balance. his speed and hockey sense can get him out of sticky situations quickly. his offensive versatility also means he could potentially play the wing, though most teams that draft him would likely prefer him to be a will likely need another season or two of seasoning and strength building to be nhl-ready. he projects as a top-six forward at the nhl level. is an extremely intelligent playmaking forward who plays the game at a very high pace and was a very effective player in all situations this year, whether it was five-on-five, the power play, or even the penalty kill. he has the ability to play the game effectively at whatever pace is dictated. if the game is wide open, he's able to use his explosiveness to blow by blueliners the second they make a mistake trying to defend him, and if the game is more controlled he has a firm grasp on his defensive assignments and won't lose his positioning. some players are able to move quickly when they have the puck but their hands aren't able to keep up. that's not the case with him. he's able to handle the puck extremely well at full speed and can make defenders look silly when he's one-on-one. he was lethal this year on the power play, and he's so deceptive when he has the puck he keeps opponents guessing what he's going to do. he displays a high compete-level, he's a hound on the forecheck and despite his size is not afraid of any puck battle. his defensive game also doesn't get enough credit. he's got good defensive positioning and shows good heart while killing penalties. he also has the ability to use his high hockey iq to read the play and cause turnovers. the big knock on him really comes down to his size. he can sometimes get bottled up when he's going on a rush and get pushed off the puck, and although he is a hound on the puck he can't really use his body to separate anyone from the puck. despite the physical limitations, a team will undoubtedly select early in the draft with the hopes he's able to develop into a top-six playmaking\", \" is a well-rounded winger who has almost every nhl attribute you want other than the size at 5-foot-11. he brings skill and speed to his shifts, showing the ability to carry the puck up ice and create chances for himself and his teammates. can pass the puck very well, but his shot is his main weapon. you can set him up from mid-range and he can finish. he lacks size, but he plays hard, showing no fear of engaging physically to win back pucks or to take a hit to make a play. he projects as a very good top-six winger who will score a lot of goals in the nhl. after exploding out of the gate to lead in scoring through the first third of the season, production hit a bit of a wall in the second half with jyp, a bottom-0f-the-table team. some of that had to do with poor puck luck (his shot generation remained high), some of it was a reduction in his ice time, and some of it was just the reality that he wasn't going to be a point-per-game producer in his draft year. he helped assuage some doubts with a six-goal, eight-point u18 worlds performance (though i thought he came and went in the middle of group play, he was excellent in the medal round). remains one of the more gifted individual creators in this draft class. he's a slick, play-creating winger who excels in possession, carves teams up through coverage to take the play from the flanks to the interior, and possesses quick, light hands. those tools enable him to take advantage of his dangerous wrister, which he can get off quickly from a variety of stances and at a variety of tempos. on the puck, he's agile through cuts and changes of direction and plays an intentional, attacking style. off of the puck, he also plays with a lot of energy and doesn't shy away from the physical side of the game, which has endeared him to coaches despite his 5-foot-11 frame. i'd like to see him slow down and utilize his linemates a little better than he does as he's actually a heady playmaker, but part of what makes him so exciting is his insistence on creating his own looks (even if that comes with some forcing it) with that shot of his. he really can sling it, with a wrister and one-timer that both pop. second line winger, who can be a threat on a nhl power-play. a high-scoring winger who put up impressive numbers over the first half of the season before being slowed by injuries in the second half, has a lot of the tools you're looking for in a top-six winger. he has one of the best overall shots among the top tier of this draft class and has higher-end puck skills that allow him to beat defenders 1-on-1 and create better scoring opportunities for himself. at the u18 worlds, he took over games at times in leading to a bronze medal. he's defensively responsible for his position and never quits on pucks. his skating is pretty good as he's shown some ability to separate, but i don't think he's a natural burner. he's best in the offensive half of the ice and can be a high-end scorer at the next level with a top-six ceiling. if everything goes you could make a case that he has top-line scorer potential. a high-end finisher with a top-notch one-timer, was filling the nets early, but an injury threw a wrench in things and he never refound his shine. he's going to need to simplify things and find chemistry with a space maker and distributor to max out. nothing about profile coming into the season really screamed top-five pick, but that's exactly where he found himself on most public boards by december. a hot start to the scouting season at the hlinka-gretzky cup and a productive first few months with jyp jyvaskyla in play will do that for a player. by the time team called on him for the world juniors, had amassed 18 points in 23 games, good for a 0.78 point-per-game clip -- the fourth-highest scoring rate among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the last 20 years over a full season. the shoulder injury that the 5-foot-11 winger sustained in the weeks leading up to the world juniors eventually caught up with him, though, and the production started to suffer as a result. it took 10 games to find the scoresheet upon rejoining jyp in january, and he only managed six points total in the final 16 games of the season. neither segment of season is especially indicative of the player's quality, though. he wasn't quite as exceptional as his gaudy point totals might've suggested through the first few months of the season and nowhere near as inept as his muted point totals in the back nine of the season would have his detractors believe. however boring this may sound, true talent level probably lies somewhere between those two blocks of his season. you can even see as much reflected in the statistics. there were signs in the underlying data that elite prospects dir. of european scouting lassi alanen tracked that the jyp winger benefited from percentage inflated totals, but you would also expect someone with so potent a shot and soft hands to outperform their expected shooting percentage. eventually, regression occurred, and we were with a clearer picture of the player in question. now, about that shot. it's easily one of the best in the class. there are only four players in our database of hundreds for this year's draft with a 7-grade as a shooter, and is one of them. he's one of a select few players who can credibly threaten as a shooter from intermediate-to-long range consistently. is most comfortable firing the outside-leg wrister, pushing his hands in front of his body, generating the desired downforce, shifting his weight appropriately, and snapping the puck on goal. that our partners at instat had him down for starts to make a whole lot of sense when you see the way he slings the puck out there. it's not enough to just have shooting skills, though. the game's best goal scorers all find ways to stack the odds in their favour with crafty off-puck movement. and gets it. he anticipates pockets of space well, arrives as the puck does for shooting op-portunities, positions his body in the best way to catch and release each pass, and generally seems well-connected to his teammates during sustained offensive zone possessions. he's always involved in the play. you'll never mistake for a retrieval artist either, but he's shown some forechecking skill and physicality across many of our viewings, too. he doesn't need someone else to do the dirty work to make things happen. and as someone with an above-average skating stride, hands, and puck protection mechanics -- can make something happen every time he secures possession. the problem with , of course, is that he's often a little too aware of his handling and shooting ability. his skills are closer to average than high-end, but he sometimes plays with the confidence of connor mcdavid anyway. the result is a lot of low percentage shots, turnovers, and missed passing opportunities. he can be downright infuriating to watch at times, more so than just about any other player in the top half of our first round. unlocking the best in at the next level should be a pretty straightforward exercise, and there's a nice package of skills there to work with. add a gear to his skating stride, introduce more manipulative patterns in his small-area game, and you're looking at a low-end top-six shoot-first forward. if nothing else, a long and fruitful career as a middle-six power play specialist is likely in the cards. burst onto the scene this season in scoring at a torrid pace and looking to smash some records in the country's top league for teenagers. however, his game cooled off significantly in the second half of the season and he struggled at times to create offense. regardless, 15 goals for a draft-eligible player competing against men is no small feat. goal-scoring is clearly greatest strength. he has an excellent wrist shot and loves to set up for one-timers on the powerplay. is a volume shooter and finds ways to get to open ice to create scoring opportunities with ease. he doesn't have high top speed, but he has an excellent first step which gives him time and space in the offensive zone. will need to work on his overall consistency and will likely need at least two years of extra before being nhl-ready. he projects as a top-six winger at the nhl level. is a talented forward who shot up draft boards to his incredible hot streak to start the season. the first thing is evidently clear about his game is his stellar puck skills. his hands set him up for success and has even seen him embarrass professional competition at select moments. additionally, he possesses what most would argue is a top-5 shot in the draft class. he is also a fine skater. he can generate speed quickly, which allows him to be effective at transitioning from defense to offense. even better, his forechecking is always a quality trait due to his stellar acceleration and strong edges. these tools also help in the defensive zone, allowing him to close in on opposing defensemen quickly, pressuring them into mistakes. in the defensive zone, his positioning is fairly adequate but his inactive stick in these instances does allow for plays to be made at the blue line. the other concern for him is how effective his offense is outside of his sniping ability. he is sometimes seem primarily as a perimeter player who benefited from his strong shot and some lucky bounces to inflate his scoring. he's not particularly strong, either, so driving towards the net is not something he does at a frequent enough pace. however, a lack of strength should be expected for a draft-eligible playing in a top professional european league. given time and the this is an element that shouldn't have long-term concern, and his strong skating and elite shot make a solid prospect worthy of his draft position. could, too, outperform that draft slot should he develop a more well-rounded offensive attack to compliment his shot and stay as an average defensive talent.\"]\n",

            " burst onto the scene as a u17, scoring the most goals by a player that age since john tavares, taylor hall and steven stamkos. followed it up with a brilliant u18 season, one of the best in the modern era. he also dominated the hlinka gretzky like few others have. is incredibly skilled and is one of the best passers in the draft. he is so creative with the puck, finding unique ways to fool defenders, manipulate the puck in tight spaces and make plays through defenders. he can make things happen off the half-wall at an elite level, makes very creative passes frequently, and projects to be a top passer in the nhl due to his vision and his pace. isn't the biggest or the quickest forward so some scouts aren't over the moon about him as an undersized forward without nhl speed. i think he skates fine but does lack ability to separate from checks. his compete level is fine, he gets his nose dirty enough and works hard off the puck to get it back. he killed penalties this season and played for stretches of the season, showing he can be a versatile player, as well. there's this thing that seems to happen with players who are labelled “smart” where, like those who are labelled as two-way players, their skill level doesn't get the love it deserves. but it doesn't have to be one or the other. sees the game differently than everyone else in this class. he sees seams others don't. he recognizes the way opposing defenders are reading the zone before the defenders even recognize what they're seeing in that zone. and the more you watch him, the more so-called concerns of strength or speed begin to fade. he has the indescribable knack for finding pockets of space to get open into (or for giving the puck to a linemate just as he enters into one of them). he's one or two steps ahead of everyone else. those things shouldn't discount the rest of his tools, though. because he grades near the top of this draft class as a stickhandler, individual creator and shooter as well. he's also one of the best draft-eligible prospects off the rush that i've seen in recent memory. he doesn't just make everyone else better. he can break open a game too. the reasons for ranking him a few spots lower have always been his skating or his strength. at this point, i'm going to stand by my evaluation. he can cleanly beat goalies from the slot every other game: but he will also spin off a defender and set up a goal from his knees scored 37 goals as an rookie, which, at the time, was the most scored by a u-17 player over the past decade before wright upped the bounty with 39 this season. so, yes, scoring is a major part of game. wrist shot has been among the most dangerous in the entire since his graduation to major junior, and he's no slouch when getting off a slap shot or a one-timer. at this point, i will confidently say that the only players with a more impressive wrist shot in the draft are alexis lafreniere (projected no. 1) and alexander holtz (potential top five pick), if that tells you anything about hard, lethal snipe. since is so confident with the puck, he's not afraid to let his creative side show. circling back to the skating front, has good footwork and can make plays at a good speed, but his overall skating needs work. he doesn't have a high top speed and will sometimes be caught standing still and watching the action around him. defensive game isn't a standout quality, but it doesn't need to be. doesn't have the size to throw a big hit and can be beaten in front of the net by a stronger opponent, but , at the very least, can use his smart decision-making to fool the other team's forwards and pick off a pass somewhere in the middle of the zone. he can score, he can make plays and his skill is elite. but what i like best about are his vision and offensive sense, giving him the ability to pick apart opposing defenses on the rush or in the zone. he can extend plays and seems to always have a plan with the puck on his stick. has a pure release on his shot and snaps passes about as well as anyone else in the class. his skating is closer to average, but that is a much bigger problem for players who can't think the game the way does. the second-best finisher in the draft? that's probably . he's also one of the draft's premier playmakers. we share worthwhile concerns with the rest of the scouting community about skating and ability to play with pace, but the rest of his game is rock solid. you want to talk about making a good first impression? record-setting 12 points (eight goals and four assists) in five games draped in canadian colours at the 2020 hlinka-gretzky cup is about as good as it gets. granted, this wasn't anyone's introduction to legend. it was just the first chapter in the second-book. the first was a real hit. the sniper put together a 74-point season in 63 games, and his january birth date isn't early enough to dampen the enthusiasm that sort of year rightly elicits. the second chapter was so disorienting a shift as to paint rian johnson's cheeks beet red. all of the sudden, went from a one-shot finisher in the 99th percentile among his first-time draft-eligible peers to a credible two-way threat with legitimacy as a playmaker. \" has an underrated playmaking ability,\" our regional scout rachel doerrie remarked around november. \"it's started to show up this season.\" the 18-year-old spirit centre averaged 0.75 assists per game at that point in the season. then found another gear, finishing the year with 1.21 helpers on a per game basis. the underlying data is every bit as impressive. not only did complete the highest percentage of his passes -- on a team that included 2019 first-round pick ryan suzuki for the back-half of the year -- but he also led the team with an average of 2.07 passes to the slot, according to the data that our partners at lnstat accumulated over the year. if there's a consistent thread that binds every part of game into one cohesive unit: it's his hockey sense. however nebulous a term that may be --and no matter how far one's mileage varies -- has it in spades. he's a cerebral puck carrier, combining a full quiver's worth of rush patterns with the consistent sense to attack in an arc to create as much space or time as is necessary for himself or his linemates. some skaters blow by traffic: manipulates defenders from his path entirely. that he's a remarkably dextrous individual, one capable of blending deception through his passes, be they on the forehand, backhand, slip passes, hook passes, etc. doesn't hurt. his terminator-esque ability to scan the ice and break down coverages ensure that possession rarely dies on his stick. he'll problem-solve his way through primary, secondary, and even sometimes tertiary variables, advancing play in a threatening posture where most might lose the puck entirely. and when does advance the puck in these situations, there's two or three defenders stuck to him at a time - - two or three defenders that his linemates don't have to worry about as they accept possession of the puck. that's by design. while alexander holtz locked up honours as the draft's best finisher; is the heir apparent to the title. our scouts haven't seen much deception from as a shooter though, which perhaps explains the year-over-year plateauing from his draft-minus-one season to this one at 37 goals -- another explanation is the rule of diminishing returns. he's good enough to take his time and dig with his plant foot before unleashing a precise, powerful wrist shot on goal, and there isn't much that most goaltenders can do to stop him. the cerebral component to game as a shooter mostly lies in his sense of timing and spacing. it's one thing to identify pockets of space within the sensitive portions of the offensive zone; it's another entirely to position one's self appropriately and time their charge just \"he's dangerous the second his team is in the offensive zone, because his spatial awareness is so good.\" doerrie remarked in a november report. \"he finds the quiet areas and arrives at the time for a pass.\" now, the speed with which so valiantly attacks those openings is another matter entirely. he entered the year a weak skater, and that's about where he finished it. our scouts have identified a hunched over stance on top of a wide base as the limiting factors to stride. he's just a little bit top heavy. only making matters worse is lack of pace or urgency. he's a nasty tendency of widening his base on entries, pulling a buttonhook maneuver, and gliding around the perimeter for prolonged periods of time with the puck on his stick. it works in the but a routine that predictable is going to prove costly at the next level. it's hard to imagine a scenario where is a centre at the nhl level as a result. he's not a great skater, does a lot of his best work from the perimeter, and doesn't offer much support in the defensive zone either. if one were to borrow seattle seahawks head coach pete carroll's mantra, the more important question is: what can do? he's one of the draft's best finishers, with elite offensive instincts and puck skills to match. there's no reason he can't consistently score 35 goals a season at the peak of his career, and every indication from this season is that he'i i bring a lot as a distributor, too. began the year looking like a goal-scoring machine. as the season has progressed, he has shown just how well-rounded of a player he is. has an excellent release, which he showed at the ivan hlinka tournament, and all-season in the he has shown excellent playmaking ability. some scouts are concerned with his skating, but i believe it is good enough and his tool kit (especially hockey sense) makes up for his foot speed. he looks like a top-six winger at the nhl level. is an explosive skater with great power in his stride and high energy, including quick feet from a stopped position to gain speed quickly and win loose puck races. sits low in his stride, giving him great agility and the ability to make tight turns to create space for himself. sometimes he lacks consistency in his effort level, which at times affects his overall speed. controls the puck very well at high speed, showing the ability to beat defenders one-on-one and fool goalies with quick dekes in tight. while his elite shot is still his weapon of choice, he has been a more dynamic playmaker this season and he is displaying a more versatile skillset than before. his shot has a lightning fast release and good accuracy, but he seems to lose power on his shot when he can't set his feet. his knack for finding open space in the offensive zone in uncanny as he seems to evade defenders with ease and settle in soft spots in the coverage. defensively, he seems better suited for the wing, using his speed to force bad decisions at the blueline and focusing his energy on transitioning the puck. he can be a bit lazy on the defensive size of the puck and could be more involved physically more consistently, although he isn't afraid of the dirty areas or physical battles with bigger players when he is engaged. overall, he has diversified his game and if he works on his consistency, he could be a solid offensive threat.\n",

            " , son of former no. 2 overall pick (1982) brian , has been one of the top players in the for the past two seasons. he's followed a unique path. after skating for sioux falls of the in 2014-15, he joined the hockey national team (usntdp) for his second season of eligibility, and was the under-18 team's second-best player this season; he currently ranks among the best goal scorers ever in the stylistically, is a scoring power winger. he's got a sturdy, developed frame, plays with an edge and brings a lot of offensive tools to the table. he shows above-average puck skills and offensive hockey sense, and has a high-end shot. in fact, he was a shots machine this season, with one of the highest shots-per-game rates in the however, ' skating has been a consistent issue in his game. he just doesn't have any sort of explosiveness in his stride. his defensive play isn't too great either, which may be a product of his skating as opposed to any work ethic issues. he has committed to university for next season. —the son of former nhler brian —is the perfect example of a “meat and potatoes”-type player. he plays the game the way, gets involved in the dirty areas, plays physically and has a drive to succeed. has a knack for driving to the net, and throwing the opposition off with his deceptive shoulder dips and quick, two-step acceleration. he plays a power-forward style of game, and engages physically, whether by making a check on defense or posting up in the slot for screen attempts. plays with intensity and drive, a great mix of skill and strength, and is really adept at knowing when to dangle a defender or bull-rush the net. he brings a diverse and mature offensive skill set. protects the puck very well and is tough to separate from it. he also has a knack of exploiting defenders who over-commit in an attempt to gain leverage. is dynamite along the wall and goes to tough, high-scoring areas. despite not being big by nhl standards, he is very physically mature and imposes his will on the ice. is a natural goal-scorer and possesses a heavy shot. he knows it's a weapon and isn't afraid to pull the trigger from anywhere in the offensive zone. he's mastered the lost art of the high-velocity backhand; goalies need to be wary anytime he has the puck on his stick in close. also has an understated intelligence in the offensive zone: he seems to always be in the place at the time, and he fnds soft spots to get open for one-timers. he plays with a dogged determination, is relentless in puck pursuit, exploits mistakes and wins battles. he also shows a bit of a mean streak and isn't afraid to mix it up at all. : is not the most creative guy and needs to be paired with a playmaker to get the most out of his straightforward skill set. he is more of a complementary goal-scorer than the guy who gets it done on his own. while his skating has improved dramatically over the past season, it still seems somewhat sluggish and he could still use some improvement in his foot speed and edge work before he dreams of getting to the next level. his passing instincts with the puck could also be refned.\n",

            " has played the entire season in second division pro league, being good but not great there, and he was the top scorer at both the u19 five nations tournament in february and u19 four nations in april. his stats aren't wow-caliber, but i have little doubt he's a high-end talent who can break open a shift. his skating is high-end, as is his playmaking. he's incredibly elusive with his skating, able to jet up the ice as well as turn on a dime. he can dangle, but he also makes plays to his teammates well and shows very good instincts. that combination allows him to be a real nuisance coming through the neutral zone and to check overall. he's more of a playmaker to me, but he has a fine shot and i've seen his one-timer and wrist shot be dangerous from a distance. my main criticism of is he doesn't always grind as hard as he should for pucks, and it doesn't help that his frame is quite slender which led to him struggling when trying to win pucks from men. if he can add bulk to his frame and get to the inside areas a bit more, the sky's the limit for him. one of the most intriguing prospects in the draft, played most of this season in second pro division. he was the top scorer among players 18 or younger in the league by a wide margin and was top four among u20 players. last season, lit it up internationally for but didn't end up making their world juniors team this turn around. he's a good skater, but needed to get stronger this year, and it seems that he is improving in that regard. definitely has high-end skills, but i think there was a reasonable expectation that he'd perform better than he did in mestis, which isn't a league you often see top finns playing in during their draft seasons. recently signed a deal with the lahti pelicans in where he'll get to test himself against the country's top professionals. a hard-working winger who demonstrates quick hands and a nice touch around the net. had a tremendous u18 tournament in 2016-17 and was strong in the second tier this season. slight and slippery. can sometimes run himself out of space.\n",

            " has been an important part of his team as an 18-year-old, playing a lot of minutes and making plays in both ends of the rink. he's a well-rounded pivot who can drive play for his team. iq stands out to me frequently. at the pro level, he's shown no signs of the pace being too quick for him, as he makes good plays at a fast speed. he works hard, is strong on pucks down low and gets back on defense but doesn't look to engage physically at times. with the puck on his stick, he can make a skilled play and shows above-average vision with flashes of high-end. he's a strong skater and i've seen him put defenders on their heels with his speed. his ability to be a playmaker as well as a primary defensive for whatever team he's on speaks volumes to his abilities. he doesn't have the skills to take over a shift, but he's a nice do-it-all type of player. , like kotkaniemi, is another player whose whole is more than the sum of his parts — and who i'm higher on than most. after dahlin and canucks prospect elias petterson, i'd argue , vegas prospect lukas elvenes, and sabres draftee marcus davidsson rounded out the five best young players this season. like tkachuk, he has always played above his age class and thus has never really been able to dominate his peers. that makes him harder to evaluate, but i believe he would have been most dangerous offensive threat had he played at u18s. he anticipates the play at an extremely high level, is strong on draws, and makes things happen away from the puck by recognizing when the play has broken down defensively and filling in the gaps. i think he'll play a big role in everything that lulea does next season and i expect he'll be a centre, not a winger, in the nhl. at only 18 years old, has spent two full seasons in the with lulea. he showed considerable progression this season, both offensively and from an overall maturity standpoint. he could be relied upon more, playing a top-six role, which allowed him more chances to produce. additionally, has a commitment to defense, with the added ability of being able to quickly transition. he's a good skater with some power elements in his game thanks to a sturdy frame and strong legs. while at the world junior championship, often started with line to set the tone for the period with their speed and willingness to get in on the forecheck aggressively. he's likely to end up more of a middle-six player who can provide scoring depth and take on some tough matchups, but i don't think he's all that far away from being an nhl-caliber forward. skilled puck-distributor has shown very well as a draft-eligible player in the – his second year in top league. his skill is unspectacular, but the nuances to his game are terrific. he's the type of player you like the more you watch him. in a centre-lite draft, his stock has risen. saw his role expand in the wjc and thrived with more ice. powerful skater.. ability to carry the puck deep using good puck protection on both sides to then put dangerous pucks in front from down low the centerman skates well, with speed and mobility and balance. he's a heady player and can produce offensively. even without the puck and away from the play, he's engaged in the play, actively seeking open lanes to become accessible to his linemates. when appropriate. would head for the net and look for rebounds and deflections. he's got a nice flair for offense, whether he's one timing a shot or supporting teammates in enemy territory. impressive decision-making with the puck. quick hands. his release is admirable, but his shot could use an improvement in accuracy and power. he shows nice vision, with a real awareness of his linemates. calm, but not afraid to grab the puck in the neutral zone and take over. he uses his body to shield the puck from opponents. defensively, he's smart and willingly shoulders a lot of responsible. with his high level of anticipation, he is able to intercept passes and take possession of loose pucks. he's not the most physical player, but he doesn't run from contact. not afraid to take a hit or make a hit. willing to run plays in traffic if necessary. a strong understanding of hockey, particularly team play, he offers a mature style of play. confident in all aspects – and all zones – of the game, he displays a commendable workrate.\n",

            " had an incredible 17-year-old season in the as one of the best players in the modern era at that age in that league. he's an exciting and very well-rounded player. he's 6-foot-4, he's a very good skater for such a large player and his hands are up there with the best in the draft. he can break a shift open with his ability to power past or dangle through defenders. his creativity is great, and his large wingspan combined with his elite hands allows him to stickhandle around defenders with ease. playmaking has been an area i've questioned – and some scouts do as well – but this season he's shown high-level vision. it's not the greatest, but it's very good and he'll be able to make nhl caliber plays. his shot is also very good, and he can score from the dots. is a very competitive player who uses his large frame to power his way to chances and win battles along the walls. he projects as an all-situations when the pace increased at the higher levels on the international stage, like the hlinka gretzky or the world juniors, he faded a bit, but i remain a huge believer because of his toolkit and his performance with his club team. he looks like a foundational no. 1 in the nhl. some scouts soured on in the second half. i was not one of them. i would chalk up most of that distaste to the creeping effects of overexposure. when a top prospect has been on the scene for years like has, there's a tendency to begin to look for things to nitpick in their games. for a while, lafreniere's skating was one such so-called concern. with , the combination of his unremarkable world juniors, his at-times mediocre defensive play and the strength of the rest of the draft resulted in debates about whether he should be the no. 2 pick. on one hand, some of those concerns have at least some merit. lucas raymond, alexander holtz, tim stutzle and even lukas reichel and john-jason peterka all had more of an impact at the world juniors than did. meanwhile, his defensive play has never been a highlight of his game, and despite winning more than 50 percent of his faceoffs this year, it's an admitted area of his game that he wants to work on — and that sudbury staff want him to work on. on the other hand, the list of things i care about when evaluating has defensive acumen and world junior performance as a 17-year-old in limited minutes somewhere near the bottom. he's huge, his skating has become enough of a strength that he can really push the pace through the middle of the ice, he's got excellent puck skill for a player his size and he's surprisingly creative for his size. he's also one of the younger players in the draft, so he's got time to figure out the rest. plays the sport's most coveted position, doesn't turn 18 until the end of august and paced for 124 points across a 68-game season. the first thing you'll notice with is that he can be physically dominant when he needs to. goals often come in close proximity, either just around the crease or below the hash marks. uses his strength to hold his own around the net and create havoc in front of the goalie, but a big reason as to why he's so successful in close is because of how he uses his skating to his advantage. shot has never been a top aspect of his overall game, but we're still talking about a player who was on pace for nearly 50 goals this season. didn't have the final explosive numbers that lafreniere had this season, but the underlying stats suggest is far ahead of the curve. defensively, strong skating allows him to get back into the battle and he has the reach to poke the puck out of danger. he isn't afraid to block shots, but his confidence in his own game and his determination to help his teammates out is special. looked like he was seriously going to give lafreniere a run for his money at no. 1, but his game-to-game consistency wasn't at the same level. game was a little uneven from midseason on, and i wonder whether the draft season began to wear on him. he is one of the younger players in this draft class but was fifth in the in terms of points per game (1.82). at his best, he is a dominant force with elite-level speed, especially considering his size. he thinks the game extremely well, with good vision and a playmaker's touch. defensive game needs maturation, but his instincts with the puck are very strong. if everything goes in his he has a chance to be special. is one of the youngest players in this class, and he's already one of its most physically advanced centres. he'll need to refine certain elements of his offensive approach to maximize his potential but we like his odds of getting there. when he does, you're talking about a no. 1 centre that can play in any situation. being a scout is equal parts accounting for what's already there and projecting where it's headed. in sudbury wolves centre , there's more than enough to line either side of the ledger. that's the reason why many pegged as the prospect most likely to supplant alexis lafreniere at first overall. even if he's not there yet, the combination of size, speed, power, and skill present in game offers the best chance of surpassing him at some point down the road. since the comparison has proven inescapable - - the considerable difference in age between the two warrants our attention. is less than a month away from qualifying for the 2021 nhl draft; lafreniere conversely is less than a month removed from last year's draft. that's 312 days apart, nearly a full year, for anyone keeping track. as such, any comparison of the surface level stats that each amassed should pit 2019-20 season, in which he scored at a 1.82 points per game pace, against lafreniere's 2018-19 season, in which he hit the 1.72 mark. all of a sudden, the two don't seem so far apart. how they produce is another matter entirely. it's one area where couldn't possibly be more distinct from the presumptive first overall pick. where most skaters seek out space; carries the puck like a power running back in the nfl does a football headlong into traffic. as our scout rachel doerrie has rightly noted in her reports; this propensity to play bumper cars rather than darting away like a drag car racer is a double-edged sword. teams want players who can operate in the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone, but that's usu a i ly a bonus and not the basis on which they operate. granted, plays a power forward's game, and this sort of thing comes with the territory to a certain degree. he's blessed with a 6-foot-4 frame, an explosive skating stride, and a set of hands so gifted as to make one wonder if there was a career spent shaping sculptures in a previous lifetime. is a special talent and, for most, is the consensus number two prospect in this draft. at just over 6'4″, boasts a tall, big frame. but, that isn't the only reason why he is ranked so high. has elite hands and is an excellent skater. he was pretty quiet at the world juniors. but that isn't a concern for me considering he was a 17-year-old playing limited minutes for the gold medal winner play can be described as “powerful,” and he looks like a game-breaker. he is fun to watch and looks like a top-six at the nhl level. due to his physical maturity, he may be in the nhl next season. a complete power he is an offensive juggernaut with big, powerful, explosive strides and impressive speeds. a dual-threat power forward that has the skating ability of a highly skilled forward boasting a heavy shot and strength to protect the puck. blessed with a huge frame and excellent athleticism, his skating is far more advanced than most of his opponents and it's tough to slow him down. uses his reach and wingspan effectively, shielding the puck from opposing players while dominating puck possession in the cycle game. impressive puck handling ability for a player his size, displays the aggressiveness and ability to handle the puck close to his body and deke defenders out of position. he has a great shot with a deceptive release and heavy power that can catch goalies off-guard with his variety of release points. his playmaking is truly elite and he is easily able to draw opponents to his position and create space not only for himself but his teammates, too. possessing an advanced defensive game for his age, he displays zone awareness and puts forward consistent effort in supporting his defensemen below the goal line. active on the backcheck, he is growing more confident in the defensive zone and should continue to improve. doesn't shy away from physical play but has room to add a mean streak to take advantage of his size and strength. he has an advanced understanding of the game and his vision is high-level, propelling him into an elite prospect with high potential.\n",

            " was easy to spot even in games because of how powerful an athlete he is. he would often be the guy to wind it up in his own end to carry the puck due to his great speed and skill. has a strong 6-foot-1 frame, isn't afraid to attack the hard areas, and can win some battles versus men as a 17-year-old. attacks with speed and skill, and while he can pull up to make a play or use his hard shot, his direct style of play will translate to the nhl. he projects as a quality top-two line you won't find anyone in the with the austrian hockey federation, or working for an nhl club in amateur scouting who doesn't like game and approach to it. he really impressed scouts all year with the way he managed one of the world's top pro levels, but especially in the playoffs, where he was really good by any measure for a player his age (before holding his own at men's worlds). i love his patience with the puck. he doesn't shy away from trying to beat or out-wait guys (whether through changes of directions out of stop-ups or curls) and he's got a really low panic threshold. he's also a good skater who never lacks in effort and always stops on pucks. he's an advanced 200-foot forward (it's worth pointing out that while he's listed as a centre by nhl central scouting and often discussed as one, he actually played exclusively the wing this year) who was able to progress up levels because of his rounded game. and while he looks a little skinny out there, he's feisty and he fights off his fair share of checks to stay on pucks. there's also a bit of a hunch to his stride but he leverages his edges well, building speed through the neutral zone to push pace with the puck. i don't see game-breaking skill or finishing, per se, but he plays with pro pace, he's a good passer, he plays on the interior, and makes plays all over the ice. he projects as a contributing nhl player. is one of my favorite prospects in this class. he has everything that you want in a power forward. the grit, the decision making and the speed. has the potential to be a top six forward in the nhl and his grit will intrigue plenty of teams. if a nhl team is looking to obtain a well-rounded power forward who can be annoying in high danger situations with his reach, is the guy. among the most well-rounded two-way centers in this class, plays an especially mature game and just got better and better as the year went on. he averaged 11:44 for rogle in the regular season, then saw his ice time increase to 14:16 per game in the postseason where he had six points in 13 games for one of the league's top teams. has good defensive skills and commitment to playing an all-around game. it took him a while to find his footing offensively in the playing against men, but he got there and by the end of the season looked not only like he belonged, but that he could start executing at the level that made him a factor in games. he maximizes his 6-foot-1 frame and has a little bit of edge to his game. there is absolutely no quit in him on or off the puck, which makes him a bear to play against. as he gets more confident, the offensive numbers are going to come because he has the skill and skating ability to take his numbers to another level in the coming years. all he needs is a little more patience, a little more strength and more ice time and it should come for him. there are few 18-year-olds who play as mean-spirited and pace-driven a game at the professional level as does. the heavy centre is loaded with tools and while none may be all that electric, he's extremely translatable. overly tenacious but with an intelligence to it. high floor, but of a lower ceiling, and a future fan-favourite. if you're looking for a throwback forward in this year's draft, look no further. is as violent and competitive a hockey player as you'll find in the entire class. he plays every shift like it's his last and it's taking place in game 7 of the stanley cup final. nearly every one of our staff's viewings starts with the austrian winger taking a run at someone on his first shift, and the hits just keep on comin'. they're a part of his game from puck drop to the final horn, no matter the score or the stakes. as elite prospects dir. of north scouting noted in a mid-season scout's notebook article, there's a real method to the madness, too. \" physicality isn't mindless. it's integral to his game. he seems to thrive when turning hockey into pinball,\" wrote. \"because when he's locked into the physical aspect, he's also winning footraces on pucks, turning board battles into inside-lane attacks, and stretching the ice with well-timed sprints to the opposing blue line.\" it's the net-front where sturdy, physical brand of hockey is most effective, though. just check out the instat shot chart from all of the 6-foot-1 winger's season, and you'll find that only three of the 19 goals he scored last year occurred away from the blue paint. that he managed to play such a taxing game almost exclusively in professional men's league settings this year -- internationally and at the club level alike -- just makes it that much more impressive. there's punching above your weight, and then there's what did with rogle bk and austria this season. and while it may have been true at one point this season that game lacked another dimension to add to his physicality and close quarters scoring, that's no longer the case. his skill and sense are never going to rate as elite-level tools at the professional level, but they've grown to the point where they're now comfortably average-to-above-average projections. his rush patterns through the neutral zone are far more diverse and manipulative than the straight-line attacks of the season's first few months, and his pace with the puck has followed a similar trajectory. some of the more advanced playmaking opportunities still elude , but he's regularly finding teammates through traffic and even showing a bit of a delay game with the puck. you just can't tell the story of season without acknowledging the leaps and bounds that he's made with the puck on his stick. at this point, there just aren't many holes in his game, period. every tangible component of his profile is at an average-to-slightly-above-average level, and the intangibles are all at an elite level. you talk to the people who've gotten to know the person as much as they have the player, and they just rave about his work ethic, coachability, competitive nature, and generally great demeanour. the next bad thing we hear about will be the first. where we once saw as a bottom-six, checking line winger at the nhl level, he's grown so much in such a short time that a complementary role in a team's top-six doesn't seem out of the question. and there are many teams in the league who hold him in even better esteem, so don't be sur-prised when he goes higher than where we've ranked him. is a player that is likely to be taken around the tenth pick in the draft, even with low offensive numbers. the austrian played in all situations in top league, however, and showed an ability to play a strong two-way game. plays which will bode well for his name being called early in the 2022 draft. overall, plays a well-rounded game in all three zones. he's tenacious on the forecheck, competes at a high level, and is defensively responsible. scouts have made note all season that plays a highly mature game. he is patient with the puck as well and can set up and break up plays with ease. loves to play close to the blue paint and isn't afraid to chase pucks into tough areas. he did this against men last season and was dominant at times, meaning he could continue to be dangerous this way at a higher level as he develops. the biggest question surrounding is his upside, particularly his offensive ceiling. projects as an nhl player, but there are questions as to whether he is a top-six or bottom-six forward. i personally project as a middle-six forward at the nhl level, a player who can pitch in offensively while simultaneously remaining defensively sound. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. is a speedy and skilled forward with so much to like in his game. with a strong willingness to play in the high-danger areas of the ice, he will take a beating to create scoring chances and drive offense. playing at an extremely high pace, his feet are constantly moving, and he's able to build up a ton of speed quickly through crossovers and quick cuts. his speed makes him difficult to defend on the rush as he can easily beat defenders wide when attacking the zone. when going wide isn't an option, he has the puck skills to play one-on-one and beat his man with the use of quick hands. with how intense he plays, it's no surprise that he thrives in tight spaces where his high-end motor enables him to drive through checks and win battles on the board for possession of the puck. he doesn't back down or shy away in these instances one bit. because of this skill, he directly makes positive impacts to his teams overall possession time while on offense. he doesn't have the greatest velocity on his shot, however, which limits his effectiveness from further out when putting the puck on net. this is something he will eventually get better at as he builds up strength but again, he succeeds because of how well he is able to get to the front of the net. with how strong his effort level is, it's no surprise that he is already showing signs of a solid two-way player. he's got some versatility as well, with the option of placing him down the middle or on the wing depending on the set of circumstances. the offensive production may never be elite at the nhl level for him, but the micro-stats is where will be very impactful given his willingness and determination to attack with ferocity.\n",

            " junior career has been bumpy to date due to multiple injuries the past two seasons, as he had hip surgery and tore a ligament in his thumb. when healthy, he's generally drawn praise from scouts, and he played well at the junior and international levels. is a very skilled and smart winger. he makes a lot of smart decisions and finds options consistently well. with hv71, was often used in their setups to make plays from behind the net, and he did so very well, finding players in high-percentage areas in a variety of ways. he has slippery skill, and while he won't often go end-to-end, he can get through defenders and have the odd impact shift with his skill. competes well. he's not overly physical, but he engages defenders well and will battle for space. his skating is fine. he can show the odd burst where he turns defenders, but his overall pace is average. good size and hockey sense have helped lift his draft stock throughout the season, as has a particularly strong performance at the under-18 world championship. he has a very good shot that he can get off from anywhere. the puck really zips off his stick. his puck skills are ok, and pretty average in terms of one-on-one stick skills, but he gets himself into good positions and helps create space for his linemates. has good physical strength which helps him protect the puck well, and he has a little power element to his game. but does he have enough skill to create on his own? a speedy forward with a lot of skill and creativity that makes him stand out on the ice. is an excellent skater with good first steps. he has elite acceleration and top speed and he can handle the puck and stickhandle his way through traffic while maintaining high speed. he also uses his soft hands to stickhandle his way past defenders. he has a strong wrist shot and can score from up close and from far out. he can play the game at both a high pace and a slow pace, sees the ice well and can make great plays on the power play where he mostly works from behind the net. he's a constant threat for his opponents to handle as he likes to challenge defenders on the outside and simply outskate them to force himself around them and towards the net. he's not a player waiting for something to happen and always tries to generate offense for his team and can create scoring chances on his own. however, he sometimes makes risky plays by doing too much on his own. he is an excellent forechecker and often can win puck battles in the defensive zone, too. he uses his speed to chase defenders and win pucks when they are trying to set up. overall, he's a very mobile player who likes to be involved in the game.\n",

            "player name: {} Fedor Svechkov\n",
            " played versus men this season, looked like he belonged at the pro level and had a solid u18 worlds to finish his season. he's very skilled, showing a lot of confidence and creativity as a puckhandler. can create for his teammates and shows half-wall playmaking ability to go with the plays he can make at pace. off the puck, he's physical, responsible defensively and killed penalties at the vhl level. the skating is fine but lacks the true quick twitch in his feet to push defenders back and pressure with speed. in a sentence, projects as a middle-six nhl who provides good value at both ends but may not be a big-time offensive player. it has taken me some time to come to terms with game. i don't like his stride, which extends back through his toes, hunching him over his feet, instead of back and out through the arches of his feet. he's also not a particularly dynamic offensive presence. he's not scary when he's out there. what he is, though, is one of the most complete hockey players in the draft. he's an excellent defensive player who has a knack for disrupting and lifting pucks, is always in sound position, and supports the play low before he even thinks about going the other way. the latter tool helps him be available for his linemates and involve through the neutral zone without needing to be fast. he also does a good job creating separation with his go-to stop-up to force defenders off of him and allow him to attack back into the space they've behind. he has also managed to produce at a consistently high level against his peers despite lacking that high-end quality that most first-round forwards possess. he's able to do that for some of the same reasons he's so effective without the puck: a lot of quick, smart plays and his understanding of spacing. i don't want this to position him as unskilled, either, because he's not. he's plenty capable of carrying the puck and making plays in the offensive zone. in fact, against his peers, those tools can sometimes really shine. he made progress in the vhl once he began playing a little less passive there, too. but the real strength of his game is in its details. earlier, we briefly brought up robust defensive play, but there is plenty to drool over. first of all, is very aggressive to the puck, puts in the same amount effort in every single shift and can be very frustrating for anyone in possession of the puck. with his acceleration and speed, he is electric and will go after the puck no matter the zone. in the defensive zone, he will do well under duress and can evade the forecheck with ease. he pivots out and wiggles his ways through. he also does a great job putting on the pressure and adjusting to puck movement on the fly. when positioning on the wing, he finds the perfect spot to be in to allow for quick movements when looking to shut down the cycle. if he is defending the rush and trying to keep his opponents in low danger, he deploys tight man on man defense to keep the opponent stuck along the boards. in terms of his own puck movement and skating up the ice on the rush, sometimes he needs to be more cautious with his decision making. on occasion, he will have an attacker riding alongside him and he will look to deliver a pass through the attackers' legs, he will misread how close the attacker is to him and cause a turnover. there are also times where he positions the puck too far wide, especially around the perimeter and drags the puck further out to low danger along the boards. if he keeps the puck tighter and closer to his body, he will have far more success and will be able to manufacture scoring chances in medium danger. methodical and responsible, is most often found where he should be on the ice in any given situation. his vision is next-level. absence of sparkling scoring numbers aside, the solidly built forward is committed to the 200-foot game and serves as a valuable asset in all three zones. he's also committed to st. petersburg next season, where we'll get a better sense of what he's capable. 10-point output at the under-18 championship suggests he might have more offensive upside than generally thought. fyodor plays an honest 200-foot game, and he's already moved on to play productive minutes in the vhl after quickly outgrowing the confines of the mhl. our scout, david st. louis, caught during some of his crossover work and came away thoroughly impressed with his high-level habits and defensive details. plays with a fair bit of pace too, which is rare in his neck of the woods. he isn't the most skilled, but there's enough there to get by. you're not going to ﬁnd many more intelligent, detail-oriented defensive centres in the 2021 nhl entry draft than fyodor . certainly, it's hard to imagine you'll ﬁnd one past this point in the draft. if you want a player built for tough matchups, killing penalties, and taking critical faceoffs late in games -- is your guy. he's going to be a favourite of whichever coach is fortunate enough to place him on their lineup card. everything in game starts with his habits. he's always scanning the ice for threats and options when he's off of the puck, maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice so that he's always prepared for what comes next. “[] rarely misses a beat in ladia's system, taking the positions at the times, showing a clear mental separation between offensive sequences and defensive ones,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a mid-season proﬁle. “one won't ﬁnd any cheating in game. where most in his age cohort display a dangerous level of enthusiasm for rush attacks, jumping early from their positions before their team has established control of the puck, demonstrates a veteran's patience. he waits for a clear change in possession to move up-ice in a controlled, supportive fashion.” takes great routes off of the puck, rotates above the puck, and often dips low into the defensive zone to create a numbers advantage in support of his teammates. he anticipates opposition routes exceptionally well and makes well-timed interventions on developing plays as they take shape. game reports are lined almost from the start of the season to its end with “perfect defensive outing,” or some variation of that sentence. he was the best defensive forward every time he stepped over the boards. that consistency was something our scouts really came to admire. if hockey sense is the force multiplier at every corner of the ice (and has that quality in spades…), then a player's work ethic is what elevates their defensive game beyond the sum of its parts. work rate is unimpeachable. he makes second and third efforts where others back off -- whatever it takes to secure possession. the data that our dir. of north scouting mitchell and dir. of european scouting lassi alanen collected from the u18 world hockey championships showcases his admirable defensive effort. our partners at instat hockey tracked on-ice data from that tournament as well, and they also frame contributions as distinctly positive. out-attempted the opposition 134-76, good for a 66 percent ratio of control with on the ice at even strength. it's not enough to just be a sturdy defensive piece in the top half of the ﬁrst round. you need to offer some level of offence at the next level. art ross trophies won't line the walls of the estate when he hangs up the skates, but he'll bring more than enough offence to hang in an nhl middle-six. that seems like the ﬂoor for a player this sharp. the supporting instincts that make so effective in the defensive zone are every bit as potent when his team is on the attack. his sense of offensive timing is fantastic, and he has a really great knack for getting open off of the puck. sometimes, he'll just hide in a defender's blind spot, then spring open for a scoring chance from seemingly out of nowhere. the forward for the upcoming season deﬁnitely proﬁles as more of a playmaker than a ﬁnisher. drags defenders into his orbit as a puck-carrier to create space for his linemates. he's a technically skilled distributor -- with the full array of reach-adjusting passes in his arsenal -- able to get the puck to his teammates through layers. unfortunately, though, offensive tools grade out as about average almost across the board, save for his 6.5-grade puck skills. that makes for a pretty limited offensive projection. his low pace approach doesn't really help matters in this regard either. perhaps can unlock more offensively if he picks up the pace and develops as a skater -- those two items sometimes go hand in hand. his stride is marred by a leap in his crossovers, a lack of ankle ﬂexion, and an inability to access his outside edges. that still leaves whichever team drafts with a pretty compelling player. he has the potential to be a nightmare for the opposition's best forwards on a night in, night out basis, and score a little secondary offence, too. every team could use centres like that in their lineup. in an overall difficult year for prospects, used the turmoil to his advantage. recognized as a high-end talent before the year began, he used every opportunity to his advantage to show why he is a legitimate top 20 talent in this year's draft. he helped to a silver medal at the world under-18's, producing 10 points in 7 games. is a well-balanced, highly skilled offensive talent. he can play all three forward positions and transitions with ease. he has excellent hockey sense and reads the play well in all zones. while he may not have a definitive “wow” factor, makes small plays with ease and makes those around him better. his skill-set translates incredibly well to the nhl level and will be a coach's dream thanks to his well-rounded, defensively conscience game. some scouts have some questions surrounding skating, but it is far from a liability. he could grow in strength, but that will come with age and continued physical maturity. overall, projects as a two-way middle-six forward at the nhl level. he is likely three years away from competing for an nhl roster spot. is the type of player who really excels at the fine details of the game. he's a reliable and consistent player, in all three zones and shift-in, shift-out. he looks very comfortable playing the position and understands the responsibilities of the role. even if he's not always successful with what he tries, with or without the puck, he's almost always in the place and applying the pressure. his defensive play is very advanced, breaking up plays and stealing pucks at an above-average rate, and he puts in a great effort in 50-50 battles. he shows great hustle in transition and a strong motor when pursuing puck carriers. he is very aggressive pressuring opponents and his strength on the puck is apparent in every defensive shift he takes. he doesn't shy away from physical play but makes good reads on when to finish a check on an opposing player or to make himself an open outlet along the side boards. he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, including driving to the opposing net. he's not a flashy dangler but he can comfortably control the puck, and there are times where he shows off some nice playmaking. he doesn't seem especially creative or crafty with the puck but he displays solid stickhandling ability. his biggest asset is the ability to draw pressure to himself before making a play, creating space for his linemates and causing confusion for opponents in cycle situations. shows no hesitation when firing from range, but seems to get his most threatening chances from inside the home plate area. is a powerful and deceptively fast skater, showing great extension in his strides and getting up to top speed quickly with strong crossovers and a wide base. while his agility and edgework at high speed still cause him some trouble when carrying the puck, uses his body to protect the puck very well. this is apparent in transition chances, when he regularly attempts to beat defenders wide with his reach and speed instead of attacking them head-on. his speed and agility aren't problems, though they could stand to improve, and on the plus side he still looks a little underdeveloped in terms of his lower-body strength, signalling room for improvement.\n",

            " had a very good season between the top czech pro league and the world juniors, and fared quite well for a player his age on the czech national team. isn't a dynamic offensive player, but he has a lot of above-average qualities with arguably no weakness in his game. he has noticeable skill with the puck, and is able to create space with his coordination and creativity. he has very impressive vision and seems to always be in the place at the time. while i like him more as a playmaker, he can finish his chances as well. is a two-way forward who can kill penalties due to his work ethic and smarts. he also shows decent puck protection skills. he's an average skater, not slow, but i don't see a separation gear. is probably a winger long-term, but i've seen him be effective at taking draws. is one of those players who just gets it. he plays a confident offensive game while still being relatively mistake-free because he doesn't take unnecessary risks, even though he's always trying to make plays. he was excellent in a good pro league as an 18-year-old and a star at the world juniors without looking the least bit out of place alongside zadina, filip chytil and necas. there's an argument to be made for to be ranked higher because i think the odds that he becomes an nhl player are really strong, but the combination of his october 1999 birthday and his general lack of truly high-end tools suggest to me that he probably tops out as a middle-six forward. after a standout world juniors performance, really started garnering attention. he was playing on the top line with filip zadina and necas and was far from a passenger with those two elite players. was more of a playmaker on that line, happy to set up the other two for the goals and playing a key role in puck possession. his patience with the puck and offensive vision are of the high-end variety. the only u20 player in the czech pro ranks with more points than his 16 was necas, who is presently among the best prospects in hockey. additionally, was under consideration to play for the men's national team at the worlds this year, but narrowly missed out. one potential cause for concern is that was sent home from the nhl draft combine with a minor medical issue. by all accounts, it's not something that will affect him long-term, but it is a thing that teams are going to be monitoring very closely in the build-up to the draft and could lead to a slide for the highly-talented winger. a right-shot winger who had his coming out party for the czechs at the world junior championships with seven points in as many games. he's a late '99 birthdate so he's older but produced very strong numbers in the czech top league this season – comparable to necas and filip chytil a season ago. he's quick, elusive and knows how to finish. the combination of his passing and shooting ability makes him a threat on the powerplay a highly touted winger, he is not particularly explosive on his skates, but his top speed is commendable. overall, he moves very well. even compared to his older peers on the czech republic's u-20 squad, he plays a mature game. due to his high hockey iq, he is capable of making smart decisions with the puck. he understands the overall game. so, despite his relative lack of experience, he is handed the keys to the power play. with the man advantage, he took over, assuming an important role, working the wing and serving as the puck distributor. he displays great patience with the puck and didn't flinch in the face of pressure from defenders. he is heady and strong enough to protect the puck nicely and he is confident enough to carry the puck all over the ice. almost every determination he makes with the puck is the one. fantastic instincts. he appears, at times, to be a mistake-free kind of player. he possesses a variety of shots – with no fear of using all of them – and he can fire the puck with authority from almost anywhere on the ice. his wrister, in particular, is strong and powerful. strong passer, with plenty of pep on his feeds. plenty to like about the forward, who, in his second year with pardubice of the czech men's league, registered 16 points, including nine goals, in 38 appearances.\n",

            " got a regular shift and power play time in the this past season for djurgarden, as one of the most productive u18 players that league has seen. has been on the prospect radar a long time. he has a lot of exciting dimensions to his game, but his goal-scoring ability stands out. he has a truly elite shot. he can pick corners from any spot in the offensive zone, with a very hard and accurate wrist shot. his hands are elite, which allows him to beat defenders clean with his 1-on-1 moves and pull off the occasional highlight reel play. while he is known for his goal-scoring, is also a very good passer. he won't be a top playmaker in the nhl, but he can find the seams and has the high offensive iq to let plays develop and find his teammates. his skating is somewhere between average to above-average for me, but i did find his game lacked pace when i watched this season. off the puck he's fine; he competes well enough but he's not an overly physical player and can be a bit of a perimeter player due to how much he leans on his shot. i have to be honest: in recent months, as i finalized this list, i debated swapping and raymond. at one point during this process, was no. 4 and raymond was no. 5. there's a lot about game i believe remains a tad disrespected. everyone agrees he has power to his game and that he's got arguably the best wrist shot in the draft (his one-timer still needs some work). but some question his small area skill or his quickness or his playmaking talent. and while he needs to continue to develop his touch in traffic and his first few steps, i would argue the third point is a lot better than he usually gets credit for. does he need to tunnel vision a little less when he has the puck? sometimes. but i've seen him feather backhand passes through unsuspecting seams or feign shot before hitting the backdoor guy with a hard pass across the crease or use the attention his shot gets to hit the trailer off the rush. that will give his game more dimension than people realize, i suspect. he has already shown he can make an impact at the pro level more than most others near the top of this draft, too. i was particularly impressed with the way he handled being asked to play a new role on the power play (after spending his entire junior career on the flank, djurgardens moved him to the slot). find success from all over the offensive zone. while a plethora of his goals come from the slot, he has managed to score plenty of goals from just outside the faceoff dots. not only does embody strong shooting range, but he can pick corners with precision. can find the smallest gaps and still succeed. the only area in the offensive zone, in which should look to improve is his forechecking. the other area in play that needs to be addressed is his puck control. last but not least, let's touch on his skating. is not the fastest skater on the ice, but he does have a wide stride and will more than likely improve his speed over time. there's a lot to like about , not the least of which is that his game continues to grow. after tacking on muscle last year, he handled the pro grind pretty well in was a major factor for the world junior team that won bronze, and he showed a bit more commitment to two-way play. he is a natural offensive talent, with an elite release and quick hands. he has vision and offensive sense that challenge opposing defenses, along with the strength to drive the net. his skating is very good, and there's power in his stride. markus naslund and peter forsberg. those are the only two u18 skaters in history to produce goals at a better rate than last season. we always knew could score; he has the best shot in this draft. it's his everywhere else that solidified his hold on the sixth overall spot. djurgardens winger is the best finisher in this year's draft, and it's not especially close. that was the case going into the season, and he's done his part to hold the throne as we close the book on the 2020 nhl draft. the list of u18 skaters to score more goals than in the is two players long. was one goal off the record set by markus naslund in 1991. no surprise there. set the record for goals in the j20 superelit as a draft-minus-one skater with 30 tallies in 38 contests just one year prior. he'd mercifully moved on to the men's squad this season, but that didn't stop him from scoring over two goals a game through three games of spot duty. his shot is as good as it gets, and it makes him a threat to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. he'i i avai i himself of any opportunity to shoot the puck too, as evidenced by the relatively even distribution of attempts plotted by lnstat in this handy shot chart. what's more, can let it rip without breaking his stride, a feather in his cap that makes him a unique threat off of the rush. it's just the sort of tool one could reliably build their career around. that seemed to be the plan for going into this season too. it'd worked for him up to that point, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? the best players are never satisfied, and rapacious appetite for improvement informed tremendous growth in every other facet of his game over the course of this season. simply put: might be the player who most developed from the start of the year to its conclusion. \"this kid is so, so driven,\" one scout told eliteprospects this season. \"he's always in the weight room, always putting in extra time after practice, always putting in the work.\" that's one voice in a chorus of endorsements leaguewide for the player perhaps most admired by the scouting community for their character off of the ice. it's plain to see on the ice, too. where an unengaged once floated between the blue lines, he's now backtracking with enthusiasm. where a passive once floated towards loose pucks in offensive zone retrievals, he now engages physically and often pins his opponents to the boards in support. he's never going to win a frank j. selke trophy for his defensive work at the next level. his odds are in the same ballpark as the rest of us at eliteprospects. but if can maintain average or slightly above average defensive metrics at the nhl level, then it's going to make him a much more valuable, reliable player. similarly, is never going to lead the league in assists. he's trigger-happy to a fault, and that often comes at the expense of his linemates' opportunities to score in prime positions. even when finds himself in an obvious passing situation, his vision often fails him. for to reach his ceiling, he'll need to add muscle, refine his defensive reads, and just continue along the course he chartered this season. isn't that just par for the course though? is a pure sniper as currently constructed, and he has the potential to be a first-line finisher with triggerman utility on the power play. he's a special, special talent, and if he can refine that talent then there's no telling where it might take him. similar to raymond, i had in my top five to begin the year and i had pretty high expectations of him heading into the season. similar to raymond, has struggled at times in the men's league, though he has managed to put up 9 goals. he did have an excellent world junior championship also, posting 3 goals as an under-ager. is a nature goal-scorer and has one of the best shots in the draft. he finds ways to get open in traffic to create scoring opportunities. looks like a one-dimensional type player, but his goal-scoring upside is high. he looks like a top-six winger who may need another year or so of a pure goal scorer and elite offensive threat, he is a dynamic forward who is an agile skater when he keeps his legs moving. while he needs to work on his acceleration and speed, he makes up for it with his dangerous shot and goal scoring abilities – and he isn't afraid to shoot the puck often. highly skilled when it comes to creating space for himself and his teammates in the offensive zone and ability to keep control of the puck. he sees the ice very well and uses his hockey iq to find open teammates with accurate passes. has a keen nose for the net and causes a lot of issues for opponents with his flair for making plays. he has built on his frame this summer and looks strong in puck battles, using his frame to protect the puck. defensively, he keeps his head on a swivel and keeps an eye on his man while also watching the play and staying in position. whether he is blocking a shot or breaking up a pass, he is invested in his own end. one bad habit he will need to break is the temptation to cheat on the breakout, leaving his teammates behind. he is a player that can make a huge impact in the nhl if paired with a playmaker and will surely score a lot of goals at the next level. seems to learn from his mistakes and will be relied upon for power plays and special teams in the future.\n",

            " has shown very well at stages this season, such as with u18 team and with second division pro league, and as the season went along, he got a bigger role on an elite team. you can see there are a lot of tools to like in game. he's a very strong skater, who explodes out of his first few strides and puts pressure on defenders using his speed. his stride is incredibly smooth, with so much power coming from every push off. i've heard some scouts call him a world-class skater; i'm not there yet, but he's close. also has high-end puck skills and can make skilled plays in tight and off the rush. i've seen flashes of good playmaking from him, but i don't think he's a high-end passer. rather, i see more often as a very good north-south attacker who can make crafty plays with the puck or use his above-average shot. he needs time to round out his game, and to learn when to play quick and when to slow plays down, but his potential is among the very best in this draft class. is all of the things the nhl is trending towards: agile, up-tempo, crafty. i fear, though, that he was rushed into too early. he was completely ineffective for karpat in the playoffs and gets caught playing on the outside. he has all of the tools to be a dynamic offensive threat, but it's going to take him some time. he needs to get stronger and learn to attack the middle of the ice more because he's lethal in and around the net when he gets there. he's also a deceptive, slick player whose tough to knock off the puck despite his thin frame, though. an average-sized gets by on quickness and skill. he essentially played a third-line role for karpat in top pro league this season. there were times when it appeared the pro game overwhelmed him, but he hit his stride in the latter half of the season and became a player the club didn't want to give up for the world u18 championship. after karpat was bounced, he was released, and made better as they ended up winning the gold medal. he was a welcome addition, obviously. \"his skating is off the charts, and that's his biggest thing,\" said niemela, the coach. \"he brings a lot of speed to our team. he's in good condition, too.\" that good conditioning allows to maintain a pretty consistent level, especially when playing for the national team. it's harder to establish that at the pro level. that said, there's a craftiness to his game on top of the speed. can play in a lot of different situations due to good hockey sense. he's still a bit of a tough player to gauge, as he could stand to be a little more dynamic, but he's got some solid offensive tools. cracked the wjc roster for the fins and did well in a secondary role. he owns high-end playmaking ability that compliments his quick and elusive style. fast and creative hands can embarrass defenders. his smaller role with a top-level team limited his overall production. has added substantial strength this season and it hasn't slowed him down. slick forward, very dangerous with the puck on his stick, always a threat offensively decent-sized centerman, he shows good overall skating, with powerful strides. his top speed is decent and he's quite agile on his skates. helping matters, he keeps his feet moving when forechecking. with a long reach and his ability to read the ice, he showed that he is good at pressuring puck carriers and disrupting their flow, even pickpocketing them on occasion. but his strength is offense. and scouts consider him a catalyst in that regard. that's his approach and he was anticipating potential passing lanes and frequently he's able to position himself for a quick transition. he's got decent puckhandling skills and was never afraid one-on-one to challenge a defender. also, he's willing to skate the puck to the net. without the puck, he's content to set up screens at the crease's edge and get into position for deflections. at short range, he's got a deadly touch. he's a natural at the defensive side of the game. when backchecking, he is constantly on the hunt for a man to pick up. positionally, he is very aware of his defensive responsibilities, whether he's playing the wing or committed as he is in his own zone, he could stand to upgrade his intensity and use his body more to disrupt the attackers, instead of only trying to cut down passing lanes. but there is plenty to like about game.\n",

            " has had a very good season between and the world juniors, continuing a trend of being one of the most important players on whatever team he's on. he was a possession beast for university and towards the end of the season became one of the team's better playmakers. he has one of the best physical games in the draft. he's a strong 6-foot-3 forward who wins battles and bulldozes his way to the net as well as any teenager i've seen in the ranks. any scout i talk to will immediately heap praise on his competitiveness and the edge in his game. his skill isn't dynamic, but he has good hands, a good wrist shot and makes smart plays with the puck. he's a very smart player, can distribute the puck well and doesn't make many poor decisions. i saw the occasional high-end flash of vision from him, but he does make quick decisions and plays at a pro pace. his skating is solid, as well. i've seen him turn the corner on defenders numerous times, but he's never going to wow you with his speed. coaches will love him because he plays well in any situation or role. one of the oldest players in the class, was one day shy of ending up in the 2017 draft. as a result, you'd expect him to be several months ahead of a lot of the players in this class. in terms of his physical tools, he is. has always played above his age. while many of his teammates played in under-17s last year, he captained the under-18 team and posted a point per game. while wahlstrom and co. played in u18s this year, he was a standout at the world juniors and in he doesn't have the high-end upside of the three forwards ahead of him, but he brings a physicality and mean spirit that all, but svechnikov lack. he's an overpowering presence whose strong stride allows him to attack in waves and get to the front of the net to finish off plays. he's also an underrated passer and while i don't suspect he'll become the primary scoring threat on a first line in the nhl, i can absolutely envision him playing on one and making an impact. he'll be a good fit with a lot of different kinds of players. \"he's just a junkyard dog,\" as team world juniors coach bob motzko said while starred at the tournament. that remains my favorite description of . taking all of the qualities of his physical play and combining that with his elite hockey sense, better-than-average puck skills for a big man and a commitment to being a force in all zones, can help a team in so many ways. playing with the edge that has become a family trademark -- dad keith and brother matthew have displayed it in their own nhl careers -- i can't imagine is very fun to line up against. but you have to be more than be big and tough. that's where the hockey sense becomes a separating factor. made confident plays with the puck on his stick during his days. when he was out there, there was a good chance bu was tilting the ice in their favor. however, that didn't always lead to offense, as he scored just eight goals this season, despite averaging more than three shots on goal per game (131). point total certainly isn't eye-popping, which is why there is at least some trepidation with him as a top-four pick. that said, i've had a hard time running into scouts who wouldn't take him in the top five, especially once those other three are off the board. the elder statesman of the 2018 crop missed last year's draft by a single day. had an adequate season as one of the younger players in the but his lights out world junior showing moved the needle for many. his hands are soft, his shot is heavy and he plays an abrasive, pro-style game. he'll be a fan favourite. big body & isn't afraid to use it. plays all 200 feet of the rink & loves those dirty areas a top-end winger, he is an above-average skater, with a top speed that can beat defenders wide. his burst could still be improved, but his advanced strength makes up for a lack of quickness in tight areas. his offensive awareness stands out and he always seems to be in the position for a one-timer or a feed to one of his teammates. for a bigger forward, he has good puckhandling ability. he excels at taking passes in stride, then heading into the offensive zone with a head of steam. he does have a habit of overplaying the puck at times, trying an extra move at the offensive blue line and losing possession, instead of dumping the puck deep and forechecking. but he is capable of impressive moves under pressure. he has a great shot and the confidence to fire it on net from anywhere in the offensive zone. the release is quick and the accuracy is good. with his power, he can be a force in the offensive zone. he's not afraid to fight through contact to make a play. can be very aggressive physically and can pester opponents relentlessly. but defensively he could use his strength better. in his own zone, he's not engaged every shift. but he does use his speed to pressure on the backcheck. he's not afraid to come down low in his own end to make positive plays. a full toolbox which comes as a result of strong nhl bloodlines.\n",

            " has been a successful player at the club and international level. he got regular minutes and power play time in this past season, and was one of the best players at the u18 level in international play. is a highly skilled playmaker. he's the guy you want with the puck on his stick at the half-wall. he has great patience to wait out lanes and sees the game at a higher level than others. he's undersized at 5-foot-9, but he's competitive – although i wouldn't call him physical. is an elusive skater but scouts' main hesitation is that his skating is not all that exciting for a player of his size. i see flashes of quickness, but at the pro level you could see a lot of attempts at making skilled plays die on his stick because he can't get around defenders. after dominating the junior level a year ago, was one of the only players in this draft to spend the entire season at the pro level. though his performance in my viewings throughout the season were mixed, has always dominated against his peers (domestically and internationally) and i saw enough in his play at the level down the stretch to believe in time there might be second-line upside to his game. greatest asset has become his ability to find space in the offensive zone to get open. he does an excellent job rotating off defenders to keep his feet moving and slide into dangerous spots. and though i wouldn't say his shot is a major asset or that he has the lower body strength of a player like simontaival, has the skill to finish off plays around the net when he gets open. and when he's not in a position to score, his skill comes to the forefront as a creator for his linemates. he will need to pick up a step and get a little stronger, but he plays a modern, crafty game. when you watch without focusing in on him directly it can be easy to come away wondering why some consider him a potential first rounder. he is undersized, and really has no stand-out abilities either physically or technically. however, the young finn plays the game to a high level primarily because of what he has between his ears. hockey sense is the best attribute he possesses, though he is also a very good passer. he skates well enough but not exceptionally, has nice vision, and is very good off the puck at finding lanes and creating space for himself and team-mates. is in the place, at the time, all the time. inside his own blue-line he has a good defensive iq and stick, and even though immature won't shy away from contesting pucks. the young pivot does not have much flash to his game, but has pretty good hands. he is also great on the draw for his age, and has put up good possession stats this year with 51.2% corsi. there are, however, legitimate questions over his offensive upside, and whether his skillset will allow him to be anything more than “just” a decent middle-sixer. it is worth noting though that last year his 1.10 p/gp better than guys like kasperi kapanen, jesperi kotkaniemi at same age, while playing mainly third line minutes in it would not be a major surprise if he found himself as an nhl second liner down the line if he develops well. spent the entire season in with assat, appearing in 52 games and averaging 14:39 per contest. he was given a pretty long leash, which is important for a player who tries to create. his size was an issue at times against the pros, but his hands are especially high-end. he's one of the better puck handlers in this class, but at his size, his skating holds him back a bit. has a choppier, heavier stride. his edges are fine, and he can use his feet to deceive, but he lacks quickness. is a smart and talented forward with an impressive acceleration, decent top speed, a smooth stride and slick edges that help him move very fluidly around the ice. his quick feet and great edge work help him gain speed and restart the attack quickly in transitions. he carries the puck up the ice well, but often prefers to open the play in the neutral zone. he has a great quickness, which allows him to be constantly buzzing in the offensive end. he has shifty hands that help him retain possession of the puck through traffic and allows him to deke around defenders on the rush. he is smart and he understands the game at high speed. he constantly tries to get into open space to make himself available for a pass. he has a high offensive awareness and his decision making with the puck is excellent. he's very creative in possession of the puck. he has a high-end vision and he finds partners with accurate passes. he also possesses a slick release, a dangerous wrist shot and a surprisingly powerful one-timer that makes him a dual threat in the offensive zone. he isn't afraid of physical battles and goes to the crease when needed, but he clearly lacks both lower and upper-body strength to be overly effective. he backchecks with intensity and provides support to his defender down low. although he can be quick to leave his own zone once his team recovers the puck, he stays very involved in his own zone.\n",

            " had an impressive season playing versus men and getting regular minutes in the del for a good club in eisbaren berlin. i always saw some skill and speed in his game, but this season i saw a high level of creativity with the puck, making difficult plays through defenders and to his teammates. he has the skill and the pace to score in the nhl. i wouldn't call him the true playmaker you want running a power play, but he sees the ice well and gets a high iq grade due to how well he creates in small areas. the last time he recorded a penalty was two seasons ago in junior club play, but i don't think he's soft. i've seen him be hard on his puck pursuits, drive the net frequently and win battles versus bigger players. but it would be fair to say he's not a very physical or edgy player. early on this season, i was more impressed in my first del viewings of countryman j.j. peterka than i was of . but as the year progressed, just continued to progress while peterka's game plateaued. peterka plays a heavier, more net-driven game (more on him later), while has a finesse and touch to his game that makes him more dangerous both off the rush and from the offensive zone in. the more i watched him, the more i appreciated the way his heads-up style allows him to impact the game as both a scoring threat and a creator for his linemates. there's a comfort level about his game that i admire. he doesn't rush plays under pressure. to have that assertiveness on the ice against professionals this early in his career is impressive. add in standout skating (especially through his crossovers), a may birthday and room to add some muscle and there are a lot of reasons to believe he will continue to progress. game is constructed around his hockey iq. yes, the young german has great vision and impressive passing ability, but the foundations for where he wins on ice have been built due to what is between his ears. it is rare for an 18 year old to be capable of playing such a mistake free game, especially in a pro league, and especially when they go into every physical battle at a disadvantage. he patrols lanes well, has an active stick, and is more than capable of slotting in for his in the defensive zone if they are caught up ice. offensively he is a pass first player who skates very well, having both good speed and impressive agility. however, this year he has shown he can be a goalscorer when given the opportunity and a good play-making despite being physically underdeveloped, thrives in the tough areas of ice. is another player with projections and opinions all over the map, but generally, there are a lot of positives in his game. the first: he has great hands and creativity. in averaging 0.57 points per game, only marcel goc, marco sturm and tim stutzle had better numbers in their u18 seasons in the deutsche eishockey liga. creates space and can extend plays. he needs to get a lot stronger, but even though he can be outmuscled, he doesn't shy away from puck battles. he makes really smart reads with the puck on his stick and processes the game quickly. the hands, passing and offensive sense all put him in position to have success at the next level. everything about eisbaren berlin winger statistical profile screams first-round upside. playing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? check. producing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? finished the year with 24 points in 42 del games, and did so producing more offence at 5-on-5 on a per hour basis than tim stutzle and john-jason peterka. showing up on the international stage? finished with as many points as stutzle at the u20 world hockey championship. hell, even some of the underlying data that i've seen on the team side shows as a shot-quality driving forward with a solid two-way profile. everything on paper suggests that is firmly a first-round prospect. if only we'd seen any of it manifest with any level of consistency on his game tape or our in-person viewings. for posterity's sake, our dir. of european scouting, christoffer hedlund, has a bit more time for game than the rest of the group. even so, that's a relative statement -- it's not like hedlund was pounding the table as we worked our way through our final board. there are, of course, some undeniable physical tools at 's disposal. the best of them all is his skating. covers a tonne of ground, with sound mechanics, a strong lower-body, and an elevated work rate. \" maintains consistent energy through shift,\" our player report reads. \"he's an unrelenting forechecker and backchecker, never gives up on a play, and wins battles through second-efforts.\" , our dir. of north scouting, and a notoriously harsh grader, even went so far as to describe skating stride as \"gorgeous\" in one of his player reports. \" wields two-step separation gear in open ice and the small-area alike: it's powerful stride with consistent extensions and under-the-torso recovery, consistent knee-over-knee crossover extension with occasional linear crossover use,\" elaborated in a player report. \"he's always in motion in transition; maintains feet through stick handling and pressure; uses changes of pace to lull defenders in false sense of security; stride remains strong late in shifts.\" it's a really solid foundation for an attacking winger like . the amenities ain't bad either. is a pretty capable puck-handler -- even at top-speed -- carrying the puck through a defender's triangle, showing a predilection for outside-in maneuvers, and deploying weight shifts to avoid contact. it's just that rock-solid foundation, complete with all of the amenities, lacks the framework to make a cohesive offensive whole. as the shot map, courtesy of our partners at i nstat, makes clear, has no problem taking the puck to the slot. he's proven relatively productive from those spots too, whether in the del or playing in the world juniors. the question, for us, is whether that is going to continue to be the case for at the next level. does he have the strength or dexterity to consistently work his way to the middle of the ice against nhl competition? does he have the off of the puck habits, timing, and spacing necessary to get to those spots in the nhl? \" is often stationary and reactionary with the offensive zone established -- this is especially noticeable on the power play,\" remarked in his year-end player report. \"he's too late to move into pockets of space despite his plus-skating. he's rarely ready to shoot in catch-and-release and one-timer options. and he relies on individual rushes to generate dangerous shots.\" another matter that works against in his projection is that he's just not an especially threatening shooter at range -- he's going to need to get to the high-danger portions of the offensive zone to consistently produce at the nhl level. \" shot is average to slightly above-average with power and shot variety,\" one year-end report reads. these limitations, of course, aren't out of the ordinary with players in this range. that's garden variety stuff at this point in the draft. it's just that there are enough countervailing points in favour that we felt it necessary to spell out our work and make clear our thought process. is a pro-ready player and the maturity in his game shows. a very good skater, he is a treat to watch gliding all over the ice with a fast-top speed as well as very solid mobility. smooth overall skater who relies on his solid skating techniques with very fluid strides. possesses silk-smooth hands and can handle the puck very nicely, constantly putting the effort in to get to the tough parts of the ice and battle for puck possession. he displays great hockey sense and he always seems to be in the place, getting to where he needs to be just slightly ahead of the play. he is strong along the boards, often coming out with the puck because of his excellent puck skills and tenacity. he can use his quickness in small spaces to evade opposing players and find open space for himself. he has a good shot, and it is more effective because of the shot locations that he finds. if he isn't getting himself to the front of the net, he is camping out on the backside of the play, waiting for a pass to one-time into the back of the net. in the defensive zone, he plays a solid positional game and clogs passing lanes, not afraid to get in front of a shot. his excellent board play aids him in puck battles but he needs to try to stay on the inside of the puck in defensive zone board battles. overall, a smart playmaker with high compete level.\n",

            " has been a favorite of mine whenever i've watched him this season in or international play. he put up fantastic numbers in top junior circuit. he's not a big guy or a player with elite skill, but he makes a difference every game. as the season went on with u18 team his role continued to grow until he was eventually their top forward. his skating is good as he often shows the ability to beat defenders wide with speed and can change speeds very well. his hands are also impressive. you'd like to see a little more creativity from a forward his size who will make his living scoring, but he can make defenders miss. i like his vision a lot. he's always looking to make a play and seems to have eyes in the back of his head. what i also like about his game is the pace he plays with. he's always attacking, hitting the zone with speed and doesn't make plays from a standstill. he shows good shiftiness on his edges trying to create space for his vision. also has the hustle you like to see in a smaller player and can play on both special teams. i have been really high on all year. when i had him at no. 43 on my midseason list, several scouts asked me why. most now have him as a second- or third-rounder. they see a smaller, perimeter player who has yet to find his footing in the i see a small kid who dominated superelit in almost historic ways and was only rewarded with seven minutes a night during a short 10-game stint with a very good team. has grown on me all year. he was unstoppable against his peers in junior and followed it up with an outstanding showing at u18s. he's also a july birthday, and his 1.5-points-per-game clip put him in historic company as one of the highest scoring under-18 players in the history of top junior league alongside lias andersson and jesper boqvist and ahead of william karlsson and lars eller. he hasn't committed to where he's going to play next season, but he's the kind of player who could benefit from playing in the if he's taken in the import draft. he's fun to watch in open ice. another player who has really jumped out to me over the course of the year, is one of the more dynamic players still on the board in this range and a personal favorite of mine this draft season. he led top junior league with 57 points this season, posting the fourth-best season ever by a u18 player in that league. his scoring rates compare favorably with last year's no. 7 pick lias andersson and exceeds those of stanley cup finalists lars eller and william karlsson at the same age. also saw some time in the pro ranks with skelleftea and even appeared in two playoff games. he followed that up with an especially strong performance for at the world u18 championship, leading the team with 10 points. in pretty much all of my viewings this year, stood out as a higher-end skill player who can get by defenders and create chances for himself and his teammates. an absolute wrecking ball of a player who has been posting tremendous numbers in the j20 circuit. logs miles of ice as he forechecks with impunity; distributes the puck effectively and knows how to finish as well. terrific international performances at the hlinka, five nations and u18's offer scouts a glimpse of his skill on some big stages. he even looked capable in a 12-game stint in the some of the best one-on-one skills in the class. a player his coaches love and his opponents hate.\n",

            " , the son of nhl agent pat , was one of the best players in the and had a great world jr. a challenge, tying the tournament record for scoring. is a very skilled player. he has the slick 1-on-1 skill to beat defenders consistently and make plays in small areas. he's an extremely creative playmaker who can make a lot of plays off the perimeter and make plays with pace. he improvises very well, making high-end plays under pressure. is a great passer, but also a great goal-scorer, who scored numerous goals off his one-timer. that combination makes him very dangerous on the power play. has limitations in his size and speed, which is why some scouts still question how his game will translate. he does compete well, attacking the middle third of the ice; and he isn't a perimeter player, although i wouldn't call him very physical. consistency is a hard thing to measure but it always comes to mind when i think about . he's not the kind of player who controls a game with any one skill. he doesn't get hot and produce a five-game stretch where he puts up 15 points and then follows it up by going pointless in his next five games. he's not a volume shooter and thus won't be a volume scorer. but there he was, at the end of his first year in the second in the league in scoring as arguably the best player on the best team. i suspect his adjustment to the game may be a little slower than expected given where he's likely to be picked, but he's got a spatial awareness to his game that should help him blossom into a dominant player in time. he reads and reacts to pressure at one of the highest levels in this draft with the puck on his stick, which helps him navigate in and out of trouble to make the small plays that drive results. it's hard to pinpoint any one element of his game that registers as elite, though his skill is on an upper tier. hockey sense is solid. vision is solid. the skating is fine. the son of agent pat , was on the best team in the and finished second in league scoring to teammate mathieu de st. phalle with 59 points in 45 games. he still needs to get stronger and a bit more aggressive in the middle of the ice, though. chicago steel centre got better with every passing viewing this season. i the fall classic last september with nothing but skepticism for the son of legendary player agent pat . as we turn the calendar on october for the 2020 draft, i'm a believer. it was his performance at the world junior a challenge that really opened our eyes. i was there with dir. of north scouting for the entire tournament, and we could hardly believe what we were seeing. his skating had improved. he was more confident with the puck. he put himself in positions to let his one-timer rip, and there was nothing goalies could do to stop it. his coach was deploying him in high-leverage defensive situations. he was a new player. all told, the tournament with 12 points in 6 games, good for the tournament lead, tied with andrei svechnikov and nick schmaltz for the wjac scoring record. he had four periods to break from the pack, but the went cold in the semifinals and that was that. that was coming out party. upon returning to the steel from the wjac, he went on a tear, scoring six points in his first two games back in a second-half sprint to the finish. he's playing four-dimensional chess; the opposition is playing checkers. however one defines hockey sense; has it in spades. he's the best problem-solving forward in the draft not named alexis lafreniere the gears are always turning. skates into pressure to deploy a gravitational pull on the opposition, and has the good sense to either quickly dispatch of the puck to a teammate in space or processes his way through it one defender at a time. it's like watching terminator's visual machinery break down every obstacle in its path; hostile, friendly, their weaknesses, etc. he's constantly moving his feet off of the puck too, playing a game of cat and mouse with opposing defenders, tricking them into vacating dangerous spots in the offensive zone, and stealing the space. it's like that episode of the simpsons where the carnies trick homer out of his own house. then -- whether on the power play or at 5-on-5 -- he'i i receive the pass with the swift, thunderous force of a one-timer that's hard to process even as a spectator. he can get that shot off from any part of the offensive zone, with his body contorted in any position. it's special. to quote , \"he's got a shot that could be the basis for a fruitful nhl career unto itself.\" much like seth jarvis and mavrik bourque; is a true dual-threat scorer. there's the gravitational pull, the pace with which he plays, the strong off of the puck habits, and an elite shot. he's an interesting skater, with more strong habits than bad, but stil i very much so a work in progress. his posture tends to sag from time-to-time, and that limits the amount of explosiveness that he can generate through his stride. his stride is also marked by a wide recovery. he's sometimes vulnerable to a toe-kick on his extension, too. generally, these mechanical issues reveal themselves most prominently late in shifts and games. it's fair to wonder whether conditioning has a part to play in these inefficiencies, but i'm not especially convinced. the simple explanation here is probably the one -- it's more of a focus issue. he seems cognizant of his limitations as a puck-carrier though. mostly, puts the puck in one of his linemates hands, and let's them do the legwork. one can apply the same principles about defending skating to his in-zone defending. he plays with good habits, mostly, but a lack of focus tends to take him out of the picture from time-to-time. he's guilty of focusing a little too much on transitioning to offence and not putting in the work to facilitate that shift safely and effectively. these are minor quibbles -- the types of things one can develop. it's a lot more difficult if not outright impossible to teach someone to think the game the way that does. the question our staff often hears in response to this affinity for game is: what about his environment? the chicago steel scored the most goals in the by a significant margin, and surely that has something to do with 24 goals and 35 assists in 45 games. here's the thing: was second on the team in scoring to mathieu de st. phalle, and the two didn't often play on the same line, at least not in our viewings. mostly, played with sean farrell and gunnarwolfe fontaine. and you know what? he was driving that bus most games. there aren't many players in this draft that have first-line centre upside in the nhl -- quinton byfield, marco rossi, bourque, and . whether these players get to that point or not is another matter entirely. as the ranking makes clear, might not have the best odds of getting there, but we rate it as a distinct possibility. that counts for a lot. even if he's short one spot in the lineup; a second-line centre with power play utility is a hell of a get in the middle of the first-round. the son of well-known agent pat , had an excellent first full season in the is a two-way forward and an excellent skater. he loves to play the middle of the ice. he boasts excellent vision and can play in all zones. will need a few years of but he looks like middle-six forward at the nhl level. skating is very smooth and fluid in all directions. when his feet are not moving, he can look like he's coasting but he can really turn it on when his feet are moving, and he is strong in transition and is able to maintain control of the puck. the only noticeable issue with his skating is his edge work and there are times where he loses multiple edges and falls to the ice, however his stride is sound and his turn radius is tight. when he has possession of the puck in the offensive zone, he delivers quick passes and has a decent shot and an excellent one timer. he does a good job of finishing chances that others create for him, but sometimes does too little to create chances for his teammates. is strong forechecker and plays the boards well in all three zones. he hunts the puck well and will get into tie-ups as he looks to regain control of the puck. he won't often go zone-to-zone with the puck, but he is strong at getting the puck into the offensive zone. he hustles back to his own zone to tie up defenders and battles along the boards but will need added strength. he is strong forechecker and hunts the puck well and will get into tie-ups as he looks to regain control of the puck. that said, his effort isn't consistent and too often he looks to his teammates to do the dirty work.\n",

            " was a solid piece for hv71 and world junior team this season. all he has done is produce wherever he's gone the past few seasons. he won't dazzle with high-end dekes, but there is a lot of skill to game. he makes quick decisions, has a quick shot, sees his options well and has good puck skills. he can be a standout offensive player, though that isn't always the case. might be below average in size, but he's tough and strong for a player his age, and he can kill penalties adequately. i don't love his skating, but he isn't dragging anvils all over the ice, and considering all the other positive attributes in his offensive game, you can live without game-breaking speed. played in the top league for majority of the last two campaigns and looked strong. doesn't excel in any particular skill, but has a well-stocked tool belt. a very safe player. is a strong, intelligent, and mature twoway who gives a strong effort in all situations and demonstrates tenacity; constantly finding ways to impact the game. he is a fine skater with good power, using long strides to get up to top speed quickly. he doesn't show breakaway speed, but has enough speed to stay ahead of the play. despite his sub six-foot size, he's very good along the wall and knows how to leverage his low of gravity to get underneath larger opponents and protect the puck with his body. he's adept at cycling the puck in the offensive zone, showing good lower-body strength and the instincts to peel off the boards and get to the front of the net when given an open lane. he is also dangerous when given time in the offensive zone, as he possesses good vision and the ability to shoot with good power while off-balance. although creative, he plays a relatively simple, smart and efficient game. he has an accurate shot with velocity, fooling goaltenders with its quick release and placement. he is dominant on face-offs. he leans offense, but backchecks hard and keeps his head on a swivel to cover the trailing man on the rush. is very defensively aware and shows a consistent effort in skating hard on the back check to support his defenders, making plays on the puck carrier. he can play both and wing but is a natural as he does a good job coming down deep to support and being part of the breakout. when playing wing he does a good job covering his point man and pressuring the puck along the wall to try and create a turnover. he shows good two-way awareness, has a mature approach to defense and some strong offensive abilities making him a well-rounded prospect. we hear a lot of chatter about being a rough skater” with feet that “will holdhi back at the next level but we do not share these scouting opinions. although his explosiveness and consistency could use some improvement, he like his developing mobility. he is a prospect with a solid overall two-way game but is not likely going to become a high-end offensive catalyst in the nhl. we see him as a very good second line in a henrik zetterberg-type, twoway role but there are plenty out there who see him as a bottom-six, third or fourth line, forward at best in the nhl. will that effect his draft status, as teams tend to go for those prospects who can fill the net and influence the scoreboard? we like him plenty and think he can affect the score of the game substantially, which is why we ranked him so highly.\n",

            " was good in switzerland's second-tier pro league, with the season canceled, and great at the u18 worlds for has always shown he can score — and in numbers. he can attack defenses in numerous ways in the offensive zone with his nhl-caliber skill, vision and shot. he is a creative player who tries to make things happen. he has the shot to score from range versus pros and is very good at creating around the net. he works hard enough to win a lot of puck battles. the main flaw in skill set is his skating, as he will be ok in the nhl in that regard but will struggle to create separation. in a sentence, projects as a strong top-six forward in the nhl, a second-line or a low-end first-line wing. there are players in every draft class who really grab the limelight as the year progresses. in 2020, it was jake sanderson, jack quinn and seth jarvis. in 2019, it was moritz seider. and while was a top prospect in his own growing up and into his rookie season in the last year, he did a lot in a short amount of time to become that player in this draft. it really crescendoed in a big performance at u18 worlds, but i would argue that best hockey of this season came in the final games of the regular season and into the swiss league playoffs with olten. after a slow start, he became a force in switzerland's second-tier pro league, overwhelming players sometimes twice his age with his size and his heaviness. it can be hard to spot “competitiveness” in players and i think we can think we see it and then place too much emphasis on it when we do, but is a competitive, heavyset player with an nhl shot and a middle-lane approach. he's going to need to work to stay in top shape throughout his career and there are still times when i think he can tunnel-vision, but he's got a real case to be taken in the draft's first half-dozen picks and i doubt he's still available at this ranking. when you are watching , the zone that you most notice him in is the offensive zone. constantly is looking for the opposition to pull closer towards the perimeter. he looks for opportunities where his teammates are controlling the puck in low danger. wants the puck in low danger and the opposition playing tight at the perimeter. he wants that because the opposition is not paying close attention to the slot. so, he picks the moment when the opposition is coming closer to the point as the moment where he skates up to the high slot and gives his team an open man close to the net. n the defensive zone, is strong on the back-check. when deployed on the wing, he shows off his physical grittiness and can be a hand full for wingers and defenders running the cycle along the boards. but, when he is utilized at he plays more of an insurance support role and won't appear to be as gritty. we've touched on stride extension a few times throughout the report, so i'm going to keep that section relatively short. even though there are some power skating issues, he has worked on his skate extension since last season with peterborough and i have seen him use a couple of lengthy first steps in the offensive zone when going to chase after a loose puck. before a star turn at the iihf under-18 championship this year, attracted positive attention by scoring nine goals and two assists in 13 games against professionals in switzerland. armed with a vicious and deceptive wrist shot, he's exceptionally dangerous in the low slot or, preferably, in and around the crease, banging in a rebound. eager to exploit his size -- this young man is solid -- plays heavy and doesn't back down from the nastier work in the corners or, again, in front of an opposing goaltender. while only a so-so skater, the swiss-born canadian is an adept passer and a tough and skilled customer, with and without the puck. thinks the game at such an absurdly high level, it's almost enough to make us forego any concerns about a wildly inefficient, poor skating stride. he's a playmaking centre with a great knack for small-area passes. may not be the best two-way centre in the draft, but he really isn't that far the more eyes our group set on , the more conﬁdent we became in our evaluation. eventually, that resulted in ascending to ﬁfth overall in our post-u18 world hockey championships ranking. that's where he'll ﬁnish the season, too. there just aren't many more reliable players in this draft than . he makes the play at the time and in the place every single shift. you know what you're getting from him every time he steps onto the ice. hardly sacriﬁces any skill for that consistency either. he's never going to manipulate opponents in space like matthew beniers, william eklund, or even fabian lysell, but his small area game is up there with the best in this class. here's what makes so special, though. it's not that he dominates in the small area game with dazzling 10-bell manoeuvres, swashbuckling his way through defenders. it's that he courts contact, using it as a means to create space. his ability to weaponize physicality and manipulate defenders is so advanced for a player this age. “some wall-play details in this game from (again),” one of our lead scouts, , remarked in a game report from the u18s. “he moves one way, drags the defender that way, makes them turn their feet, and then passes to supporting teammates in the opposite direction.” “he seems to have an instinct for it in small areas. he also gets off the wall to attack inside and plays the goal-line role well on the power play; he spins from his position to attack the net and has a knack for ﬁnding holes in the goalie as he does it.” if that weren't enough, unrelenting work rate makes him a constant threat without the puck, too. his off-the-puck pace, in particular, stands out as a distinctly positive quality. “when he doesn't have the puck, he's shoulder checking in the defensive zone,” our lead scout rachel doerrie remarked in a game report. “in the offensive zone, he hunts it like a dog on a bone. it's fantastic to watch, and will be very effective at the next level.” he's one of the draft's legitimate dual-threat scorers. the data that eliteprospects dir. of north scouting collected from play at the u18s has him calibrated as more of a playmaker than a sniper, though. there are some goal-scorer's tools in toolbox. he's a net-front driven forward with a real knack for pouncing on loose pucks and banging rebounds home. he draws from a wide array of releases, employing the one-timer, catch-and-release, and two-touch shots, sometimes with a little blade deception, too. for all of projectable offensive components, perhaps no part of his game is quite as reﬁned as his in-zone defensive play. he reloads high early, doesn't cheat, uses his reach to steal pucks, consistently scans for threats, and is an unrelenting physical force along the boards. we have to broach limitations as well though. that conversation starts with his skating. he's hardly moving like a mark 1 tank at the battle of the somme, but upright skating stride with a lack of limb bend limits his explosiveness in space. for all of his plus-level habits to manoeuvre in small area scenarios, just isn't all that dynamic with the puck either. to credit, he's aware of his limitations, and he plays within them. there's something to be said for that level of self-awareness at an age where that's not an especially common trait. give it some time and has the potential to play as a no. 2 centre in some lucky lineup. he's going to take tough matchups, feature in both phases of special teams, and bring more than his fair share of secondary offence to the table. was a victim of the shut down last season. while he did play some games for a lower league in switzerland, he looked most dominant at the world under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games. there is a lot to like about game. at 6'2, 207, he is already physically mature. at 17, he scored 29 goals in the last season, showing he has some great natural goal-scoring ability. has an excellent shot and he is incredibly creative offensively. what makes stand out in comparison to other players with similar skill sets is his drive and competitiveness. he rarely gives up on plays and is tenacious on the forecheck. loves crashing the net and putting himself in tough areas to create scoring opportunities. the combination of both skill, competitiveness, and tenacity puts as a potential top 10 candidate in this year's draft and his overall package stands out. some scouts have some concerns over skating. while he may not have the top-end speed of other prospects, his game doesn't primarily rely on it to succeed. his top speed looks high enough to not be a detriment at the nhl level. projects as a top-six forward at the nhl and is likely a year to two years away from competing for a roster spot.\n",

            " didn't have a great club season with karpat's junior team, but his excellent u18 worlds was a reminder of how good he looked as an underager. is an excellent skater and his shifts have a lot of energy to them because of how quickly he can transition pucks and dart around the offensive zone. he has very good skill and can make plays, but his offense comes through his shot and how he can score from range. for an undersized forward he stays on the perimeter too much, though, and isn't hard to play against. in a sentence, projects as a second-line winger who can be on an nhl power-play unit but may also frustrate a coach. i really don't love using comparables but gives me another player vibes, for good and bad reasons. i was too high on him in his draft year and beyond and i've tried to re-evaluate why ever since. they're different players, but is a 5-foot-10 shooter who doesn't score as much as he should. both are players blessed with natural gifts who've always seemed to produce at rates lower than they ought to. he's a better skater than he was at the same age, which should help him run into fewer obstacles as he progresses up levels, but he was also more dynamic with the puck. a plus-level skater who has good hands and a dangerous mid-range shot that allows him to score some pretty goals, but there are times when i think he forces his looks and takes too many low-percentage shots from the outside. when he plays an up-tempo, energizing game, he's very effective. his skill makes him a lot of fun to watch when he's surrounded by talented players, too (as was the case at u18s). but i do have concerns about his ability to make things happen himself and his processing power (ie. his choices with the puck under duress). loves to drive the rush and be active in the neutral zone offensively. in the defensive zone, does a great job of psychologically trapping you. i would like to see better decision making from . has excellent shooting range especially on one-timers and looks to be physical down low in the corners. defensive transitional play is solid. as mentioned earlier, struggles with speed and it's quite evident on the forecheck. but, in most cases, we see struggle to move the puck around the last defender when on the rush. he isn't a deceptive stick-handler. scoring goals is what this winger does, and does very well. a sniper by nature with an outstanding wrist shot, turned heads by potting five goals in seven games for at the under-18 championship. but he also contributed six assists, proving to a world audience there's more dimension to his offensive game than putting the puck in the net himself. high hockey iq and superior skating aside, is projected as a late-first/early-second round draft selection because he marks up the scoresheet where it matters most. there's something to be said for the straightforward nature of game. you know what you're going to get from him every time he touches the puck. some players just go. they don't ask for permission. they don't play within any structure. they don't need a regimented plan of attack. they just get the puck, and they make a beeline for the opposition goal. is one such player in the 2021 nhl entry draft. he reloads to swing wide on his team's breakout, collects the puck in stride, accelerates through knee-over-knee crossovers, and drives play across the offensive blue line. blink, and you just might miss him. you can see how leverages that skill in transition captured well in elite prospects dir. of european scouting lassi alanen's data set. he's creating zone entries at 5-on-5 at among the highest rates in alanen's manually tracked data set from the 2020-21 u20 sm-sarja season. “ skating is high-end for this level of play, and he can beat defenders outside consistently, which might not be that projectable in the long run but is deﬁnitely fun to watch,” alanen, who is based in noted in a january game report. any concerns about the projectability of approach are easy enough to understand. he's not a particularly inventive or creative handler. his habits aren't great either. attacks in a straight line, with the puck out in front of him, and always tries to turn the corner on opposing defenders. he gets serious tunnel vision, misses passing options, and just winds up circling the zone on many occasions, failing to ever register as a scoring threat. he's managed to overpower the defenders at the sm-sarja just ﬁne, but it's not something our staff would bank on translating at the nhl level. maybe can leverage his speed to create zone entries, but rush offence in the big leagues might be easier said than done. it won't happen with signiﬁcant skills reﬁnement anyway. that's a shame. has a wicked wrist shot, and he can get it off in-stride from either foot. it's easily an nhl-level tool. it's not like he's particularly adept at ﬁnding soft ice or creating shooting lanes off of the puck in the offensive zone, either. “i saw the same problems that were present in the u20 league: slow decisions, tunnel vision (missing teammates and opportunities for give-and-gos), late off-puck timing,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a november game report. “some of that could improve, but is not incredibly skilled either. the release stands out, but the rest is slightly above-average only. it won't make up for the lack of scanning and processing.” there are two separating skills in toolkit: his shot, and his foot speed. he's just lacking the craftsmanship to form them into a cohesive package, and we have concerns about whether he'll ever process the game well enough to change that. the play for long-term is to probably leverage that work rate, skating, and shot into a bottom-six checking role with some secondary scoring upside. another player who excelled at the under-18 championship, is a small-skilled forward who managed 11 points in 7 games. has a lot of raw tools and untapped potential. he has elite hands, shot, and skating ability. can create offense easily off the rush and he is quick and elusive with the puck on his stick. his lack of size is less of an issue because of his explosive skating, agility, and ability to use his edges well. the biggest question mark surrounding is his ability to read the play and adapt to it. there are times when he struggles with overall on-ice awareness and instead relies on his speed and quickness to create offense. this works well against his peers but may be an issue at a higher level. if goes according to plan, may be one of the better offensive players in this draft. that being said, there are still quite a few question marks and he will likely need extra time (3-4 years) before being nhl ready. is sharpshooter with one of the best shots in the class. he has a strong wrist shot, mixed with a quick release and excellent accuracy. he's a quick and agile skater who generates good speed and acceleration with tight crossovers but struggles to beat defenders with speed consistently due to a lack of consistent power and extension in his strides. while this limits his impact as a puck carrier in transition, he has good vision with the puck and he is able to find open space off the rush to get into a good shooting position. he's an advanced playmaker who sees lanes open up and can be deceptive with his intentions. he can make hard, accurate one-touch passes. he can receive and handle the puck in full flight and has the skill to undress defenders or shoot from the rush. he displays a shoot-first mentality, showing the confidence to fire from outside the dot lanes. he has a lightning-quick release and he is able to get heavy shots off without having to take time to transfer his weight. while his proclivity for shooting can make him a bit single-minded off the rush, his creativity and quick feet allow him to be deceptive in the offensive end, creating dangerous passing lanes and open pockets of ice for his linemates. he is more involved from the wing in the defensive end and transition than most of his junior peers, showing some shifts where he's a real difference maker and putting himself into good spots for loose pucks and pass breakups. he's not as engaged physically as he could be, particularly on the forecheck and along the boards in his own end, but is an opportunistic player who shows good awareness and the ability to create scoring chances by himself. there are times when if effort level is lacking, as he hangs back and waits for his teammates to do all the work for him. on occasion, he doesn't dig in for puck battles, is slow on the backcheck, and flies his defensive zone too early. he also doesn't move his feet enough to get open on the power play at times, which wastes his shooting skill much of the time. there are also times where his reads are off, almost like he's not thinking hard enough about the play unfolding in front of him.\n",

(thanks to twitter user tuomo vartianen for pointing this out). at his ultimate upside, he could be one of the more dynamic scorers in the nhl. puljujarvi is an offensive fxture who skates like the wind and provides size. he has an explosive frst step for a big body and has no noticeable faws in his stride. there is great extension on his skating stride when he is moving fat out, allowing him to control the speed of the game. his acceleration is spectacular for someone his size, allowing him to get the quick jump once he recognizes a spot to where he needs to get. despite being noted as a scorer, we think he is just as profcient as a set-up guy. puljujarvi keeps his feet moving and remains patient until he is content with the of the play before passing the puck. his vision is near the top of this class and he is able to lay out situational passes of each unique scenario. he works well with limited space and has the puck skills to maintain possession in open ice while in motion or working under duress. puljujarvi oozes high-end skill and awareness, showing an ability to remain elusive. he loves to drive to the net from the perimeter with or without the puck, showing readiness to make a split-second move to create an opportunity. he does a good job of drawing defenders to him and opening up opportunities for teammates. he boasts a powerful shot and a goal-scoring instinct to fnd lanes that allow him to be a threat from anywhere. he is constantly moving his feet and never remains fat-footed, always looking for an open area of the ice where he can pick up the play. while he pitches in and plays on the boards, puljujarvi has a noticeable style of circling a scrum and preparing himself to pick up a puck and carry the play to open ice. he is hard to play against and a real threat to overthrow possession on the forecheck. defensively, puljujarvi shows hustle and tenacity. he recognizes threats and backchecks all the way to his goal. he plays with the range of a and reads the play to go where he can offer support. his wingspan is a huge asset as it allows him to get to the puck and limit the range of his opponents. puljujarvi follows puck movement well and has quick reactions that enable him to steal pucks and transition the play up ice. puljujarvi can manhandle opponents in a lot of matchups, but his physical checking game does need refnement. he needs to square up the body a bit better to avoid taking himself out of the play when delivering a check. while he can dominate, he also has his moments where he melts into the background. while we believe he will put up his share of points, the big difference between him and laine is the projected nhl offensive upside. it's not really a weakness of puljujarvi's, but more a reason why he is slotted at number three for fc\n",

            " didn't have a great season, mostly due to the limited role he played on a high scoring team, where he averaged less than 10 minutes of ice time but did get some power play time. he looked very good at the u20 level and in brief deployment at the junior level in but he didn't blow doors down this season. he remains a top prospect because of his incredible talent, hockey sense and his performance when he played versus his peers. as an underage he dominated junior league as a 16-year-old and helped carry u18 team to a gold medal. with the puck on his stick he's incredibly dangerous. his hands are elite and his ability to beat defenders 1-on-1 clean in ways unlike other players can create a lot of highlight reel moments. he will be a true pp1 quarterback in the nhl because of the unique plays he can make. he has a unique way of navigating with the puck in the offensive zone, showing the patience and vision of a top nhl playmaker in how he picks apart defenses and find seams. isn't the biggest guy and isn't a guy you will tab to kill penalties, but he competes well and gets to the net. while he's more of a passer, he does have a good shot when he looks to shoot. my one concern is his just average footspeed, particularly as a 5-foot-10 forward. he has good edgework and a powerful first step, with a wide stance he employs when trying to protect pucks but lacks an nhl caliber separation gear. though never quite got his game to the same level as the other top-ranked draft prospects this year, his blend of puck-hunting when he doesn't have it and crafty playmaking when he does make him a truly unique player in this class. is a fearless puck carrier who can pick apart teams in the offensive zone at even strength with a quick stutter or a surprising pass or run a power play as the primary entry option and quarterback. he still needs to add some strength, which will improve on his mid-level straightaway speed (his footwork is already high-end) and the threat of his shot (his release is deceptive as is), but the rest is there. and while he may be a little further away from his nhl peak than some of his peers, the long-term payoff may also surpass them. when you watch closely, you see just how remarkable he is in every zone. in the offensive zone, he is constantly applying pressure and forechecking. when is in the neutral zone with the puck, you can expect him to glide up the ice in transition. if he does not have the puck in the neutral zone, is pressing up against the attacker and blocking his opponent from completing a zone entry. in the defensive zone, might not apply as much pressure, but his is hovering all over the ice surface and constantly uses his frame to press up against his opponents mid-cycle. has been one of the hardest players to evaluate in this class because he is too good for junior league but not quite good enough to play an elevated role on a perennial powerhouse laden with veteran talent. he averaged under 10 minutes of ice time in 33 games and was either healthy-scratched or played as the extra forward an awful lot this season. he had 14 points in nine games in under-20 league, as well. his one-on-one skills, skating and willingness to battle for his ice are plus traits. there might not be a more complete winger in this year's draft than . he plays such a mature brand of hockey for someone so young. some have cooled on as a result of lacklustre scoring totals this year in the but almost all of that can be attributed to a lack of opportunities as a result of playing on one of the strongest sides in the first tier of players in this year's draft is three skaters long, and it ends with winger . that's where he started the season, and that's where he'i i finish it. that might strike some as bold based on surface-level data from a season spent primarily on men's team in the the 10 points to credit through 33 games hardly jump off the page. as always, context is king. played fourth-line minutes with fourth-line support pieces and only featured sparingly on the second power play unit. good luck finding an under-20 skater that's going to perform much better under those circumstances. at the very least, it's a much more hostile setting than the where alexis lafreniere and quinton byfield. when the three lined up at the u20 world hockey championships in december and january, quality revealed itself. his 0.57 point per game clip is well ahead of byfield (0.14 ), even if lafreniere's two points per game rate dwarfs both their marks. it's last year's performance at the u18 that established legend. the eight points amassed through seven games were the second-most on a hat-trick --including the overtime goal -- in the gold medal game among them. those eight points were second only to rod ion amirov among draft-minus-one skaters. simply put: is the most complete winger in this year's draft. there isn't anything he can't do. skating is the matter of some debate in the public and private sphere alike. nobody seems to rate it as bad, per se, but some would have you believe it's barely above average if that. don't count us among them. when one puts the puck on stick, his two-step explosiveness sees him shoot up the ice as if sent from a cannon. he's a mechanically refined skater, generating straight-line speed with ease, and combining it with lateral quickness and potent weight shifts to skate through and around opponents depending on what the situation calls for. here's where really builds separation, if you'll pardon the pun. where most elite skaters this age only have it in them to play at their top speed; changes the tempo and pace to create space for himself as a puck-carrier gaining the zone. it took others years in the nhl to figure this out. already got it under control. the icing on the cake? can handle at his top speed, can shoot through his top speed, and he can distribute the puck at his top speed. one might count the number of players in this draft that can perform any one of those tasks at their top speed on one hand. there's a great harmony between hands, feet, and even his brain. we've seen him consistently problem-solve against complex defensive arrangements, often working through secondary and tertiary variables in such a way as to advance play, sometimes creating scoring chances out of seeming dead-end situations. he's more of a playmaker than a finisher. brings an above-average shot and can finish from short-to-intermediate ranges. he's also the type of puckhandler that can thrive in small ice scenarios, so there's never much impetus to take low percentage shots -- the data backs this up, too. he'll drive play. he'll drive percentages. he has the potential to be the offensive engine of whichever line hosts him for the majority of his nhl career. in terms of what he'll need to do to hit his ceiling and improve as a player; our dir. of european scouting christoffer hedlund believes that will need to play an increased role with next season. added time in the gym won't hurt either. even so, hedlund rates as carrying top-line potential as an elite two-way winger. the risk factor is relatively low with . one can comfortably invest a high pick in this type of player and not lose sleep. whether that'll happen or not remains to be seen. taken a bit of heat this year for seemingly low boxcar stats and a lack of overwhelming, obvious skill. one has to split hairs this high in the draft. i get it. whichever team drafts though is going to be so much better for it. the mature brand of hockey that this 18-year-old swede brings to the table means that they won't have to wait long to see that pay off in their nhl lineup either.as if sent from a cannon. he's a mechanically refined skater, generating straight-line speed with ease, and combining it with lateral quickness and potent weight shifts to skate through and around opponents depending on what the situation calls for. here's where really builds separation, if you'll pardon the pun. where most elite skaters has been a tough player for me to evaluate this season. back in november, i had him pegged as a potential top-three candidate, but he has since dropped in my evaluations. i do still think he will be an excellent nhl player, however. falls into a category of “hard to evaluate” at times because he is playing against men in because of this, he hasn't put up great offensive numbers and it's hard to determine his offensive ceiling. however, he is also a player i have been able to observe more frequently recently. he has excelled offensively at the beginning of the season and any question surrounding his offensive ability has been answered for me. has shown flashes of the brilliance that had him in my top three to start the season. he is exceptionally dangerous off the rush and is extremely creative. the biggest red flag for him has been he has been able to do this against his peers, but not with success against older players. is young, but he will likely need some extra time to help his overall confidence and ability to transition his tool kit to a higher level. he is arguably the best one-on-one player in the draft. is an elite offensive talent that has the hockey iq to play a strong two-way game. he is a very high-end skater that excels in all areas of skating from having the ability to make short, quick cuts to possessing a top speed that blows most out of the water and terrific edges that he uses to elude defenders offensively. he has a fantastic speed and agility combined with a great puck handling and creativity, which makes it hard for defenders to keep up with him. a high-motor player who keeps his feet moving in every situation and capitalizes on his elite hockey sense and skating in all situations. his shot is very good, as he locates it well and he gets it off quickly. the power behind his shot is sometimes inconsistent but that should be improved with added strength as he physically matures. his passing ability is crisp and accurate. he can make virtually any pass in the offensive zone, filtering the puck towards the net in the process. his defensive game is predicated on being aggressive and getting his stick into passing and shooting lanes and he excels at taking the puck away with stick lifts and closing out players on loose pucks. he isn't an overly physical player, but he doesn't shy away from contact in the corners. with some added size, he should be able to win more board battles than he already does because of his stick-skills. with his hockey sense and offensive skills, he ticks all the boxes.\n",

            " had a fine season, including lengthy stints in top league, playing in the top nine for at the wjc and excelling during under-18 tournaments. he skates pretty well, and while he doesn't have blazing speed, it's certainly above average and enough to pressure defensemen off the rush. he's a very skilled and smart offensive player who won't make overly flashy plays but makes quick, creative decisions and moves the puck very well. his vision is high-end and can be a real threat on the power play. hockey iq translates well to defense, where he's shown during international play he can be quite effective, even when playing ahead of his age group. the main issue with is his physical game. he's 5-11, 170 pounds and doesn't engage as much or as well as you'd hope someone would with his frame. is a relentless and determined workhorse who plays an aggressive game on the penalty kill and shows well on and off the puck. defensive game and overall awareness is remarkable. he makes smart plays to get the puck out, will offer support down low in his own end, and is active in trying to separate the puck from the man. he will take a hit to make a play, dishing the puck off under pressure and absorbing the check on the wall. pressures the point and positions himself in the area of the ice. his awareness and hockey sense all over the ice is a strength. he knows where the puck is going, making his anticipation and reaction a major strength of his game. makes excellent short-range passes as he helps to pull defenders in close and open up some space to get a shot off. has a nose for the net and is constantly buzzing around the slot and driving the net for rebounds at even strength. can fly up ice when he gets moving thanks to his above average acceleration and good first step form stationary. with all that, however, he lacks high-end offensive skills that will make him a point producer at the nhl level. his upside is limited, but as long as an nhl team knows what they are getting, he does have value as a bottom six and pk specialist.\n",

            " has shown for years that he is a unique prospect who projects to become a foundational player for an nhl franchise. he's dominated the scoring more than two points per game this past season. he was the mvp of the world juniors and has been great at other international events. i remember going to games where i thought he didn't look himself and he still put up multiple points. he has truly elite skill and some of the best hands i've ever seen. has made some of the most creative plays i've seen in the past few years, and with his skill he's always a second away from a scoring chance. he beats defenders in unique ways and catches them off guard with the moves he makes. he's also a very good passer who makes quick, crisp passes, and his elite creativity translates to his playmaking. he has a great shot, too, with the ability to score from mid-distance. on the power play he's a menace due to how he can beat defenders 1-on-1, find seams or pick corners. is a highly competitive player who plays well in the hard areas of the ice, is solid defensively and plays physical. he sometimes pulls up a bit too much to use his skill and playmaking, but he shows no fear driving the net. his skating and pace is the area to point out if you were to pick a weakness. i debated between a 50 or 55 for his skating. i see good flashes from him with his skating, but i see a lot of shifts where his game lacks speed and pace, and he doesn't seem to have truly explosive quickness; but he is quick enough and when he wants to go he has enough speed to look like he can be an average nhl skater. wasn't just the most talented player in junior hockey this season, he was also probably the strongest on his skates (which says something considering underneath one of his skates was a taped ankle for most of the year). he can play through defenders with his touch and stickhandling ability. he can play around them with his speed. or he can lean on them, leverage his strength, drop his shoulder and drive to his spot. and when he doesn't have the puck, he knows how to get open, where to go to get it and how to engage physically. he's never going to be the fastest player in the world or have the hardest shot, but he has all the tools he needs to be a dominant player with and without the puck at the nhl level. his shot has also become an underrated quality to his game. he made waves when he scored 42 goals in his first of three seasons but scouts began to question how dangerous his shot was when his goal pace dropped in each of the next two seasons. i've seen some nice growth there, though. when his production really began to skew toward playmaking this season, it looked more like a choice than a necessity. he can overpower goalies when he wants to lean into it: but he also does a good job getting his shot off under pressure or releasing from an off-balance stance, as he does here: he could've broken the 50-goal mark across a full season if he wanted to. there were times this year where he looked downright bored out there: is stunning in transition. his ability to get the puck through tight gaps is something that many prospects at his age struggle with. in the offensive zone, can do everything that you want him to do. when it comes to his shot, fires at all cylinders and he can burn you from anywhere in the offensive zone. also, loves to run the cycle and running the show. the defensive zone is weakest zone, but he is still strong defensively. last, but not least, skating is effortless. as i mentioned before, his crossovers and his edge work are constantly in fine form. there is no debate at this point as to who should go no. 1. it's by a significant margin. over the past 20 years, only two players 18 years old or younger had a points-per-game average higher than 2.15 this season: sidney crosby and jonathan drouin. thinks the game at a high level, with elite anticipation and an understanding of what to do with the puck immediately after he gets it. he has a physical edge and initiates contact more than most top picks of recent years, separating players from the puck with regularity. we've seen emotions get the better of him at times, but he has a competitive fire. he wants the puck at all times, in all situations. and he has the skill and hands to make things happen when he has it. few other players exude the level of confidence has shown over the past two seasons. he's the best playmaker in this year's draft, a physical specimen who combines otherworldly hockey sense with sublime puck skills to form the complete offensive package. is going to step into the nhl whenever the 2020-21 season starts, and he'll make an immediate impact wherever he lands. you've doubtless heard name roll off the tip of every scout and hockey analyst's tongue at one point or another for nearly half a decade. he's that type of talent. this season was hardly the last step of a saunter from saint-eustache, quebec to the top spot on the 2020 nhl draft's podium though. the concerns that many scouts held about skating, widely panned as below the nhl average, represented a crack in the armour ripe for another top prospect to exploit. \"i think a lot of people are going to chailenge for no. 1 overall,\" one scout told me at the hlinka gretzky cup. \"his feet are a problem.\" correction: his feet were a problem. they're now just a cut above average, as expressed by the 5.5 grade that our omjhl scout meted to . everything else? well, you can read the player's grades, and they're all at or near the top of the chart. it should come as no surprise then that the same is true of standing among the players accounted for in our dir. of north scouting 's tracking project. the seal adjusted scoring metric that jeremy davis crafted rates as the second-most prolific scorer in his draft class; his draft-season carries a 100 percent xls rating, too . has been the consensus number one prospect for this draft for two years now. this season, he has shown even more so why this is the case. has elite skill and hockey sense. he also uses his frame well to protect the puck and create offense. whether dominating play down low or great offense off the rush, boasts a strong tool kit that will land him in the nhl immediately next season. he was the mvp at the world juniors. has no glaring weaknesses in his game and will help the team that drafts him immediately. he appears to be a genuine nhl star with elite potential. a smart and versatile forward, he has earned many accolades going into the draft as an offensive juggernaut and rightly so. though his skating hasn't been celebrated as much as his other skills his acceleration and first steps need to improve he has a powerful stride that gives him an above average speed. he has some strong edges and a great upper-body strength that help him protect his puck effectively. he is easily the smartest player one the ice amongst his peers and he thinks the game quicker and better than anybody. although he loves to make simple passes to keep possession of the puck, he's very creative. his offensive awareness, instincts, anticipation, decision-making, creativity and poise are all elite. he always has his head on a swivel, and he spots open players with such ease. he loves to feed his linemates in the slot and he's able to find perfect passing lanes despite multiple stick and skates. slick hands and a quick release on his shot, he is a dangerous combination of goal scorer and playmaker. offensively, he continually showcases his tools and the potential to be a franchise player. the only knock on his game is defensively, he needs to improve his compete level and work harder at protecting his own zone. overall, he is very confident and poised with the puck, and no matter how much pressure is under, he stays calm and collected to make the best play possible. it's no secret he has endless potential and is already physically mature enough for the nhl and will undoubtedly be there next season.\n",

            "player name: {} William Stromgren\n",
            " took positive steps this season, becoming a good scorer and looking competent versus men. physical tools are easy to spot when he's on the ice. he's 6-foot-3, can skate and has great hands. he has the ability to create clean zone exits and entries with a high frequency due to his reach, speed and skill. his offense is very north/south and direct, as while he can make some plays i wouldn't call him a great passer. he's not a physical player or a top pk option, but gets to the net and creates around the tough areas of the ice. in a sentence, has some clear nhl attributes but with his sense and compete, his nhl role is unclear. i've talked to a number of scouts who have strömgren as a first-round talent in this draft, and i debated him as high as 27th or 28th (i think he'd probably be a reach for me in front of any of the players 26-and-up on my board) throughout this process. though the gut instinct with a player his height is to expect them to play a power game, strömgren is more of a skill type. he'll beat you with a quick backhand-to-forehand cut into a scoring chance, but he doesn't play a power/physical game and he still has some room on his frame to get a little stronger so that he can play a more forceful style. he's very comfortable with the puck on his stick for a player his size, which helps him carry the puck over the line and make plays in transition with his decent speed. after dominating the junior level, he didn't look out of place in second or third-tier pro levels this year either. i don't think he's ever going to be the primary driver on an nhl line, which kept him out of a first-round ranking, but he's got a chance to be a complementary scorer and i've been impressed by his ability to find teammates through layers as a passer. throughout his junior career the big forward has stood out due to his skating ability. it is rare to see a player with such a large frame for his age burn smaller defensemen, let alone out-manoeuvre them in close, but against players his own age strömgren is capable of just this. now, he has not fully grown into his frame yet, and as such he can occasionally look slightly “bambi-like”, especially with his up-right skating style. but the lower body strength, edge-work, and power when in stride are there already. strangely, strömgren actually looks a better skater with the puck on his stick that with-out, as he seems to get lower to the ice and in turn waste less energy. that being said, skating will never be an issue for strömgren, and with some extra strength he will likely be able to drop a shoulder and get past most nhl defensemen in future. arguably his stand-out skill is his shot. his one-timer is up there as one of the best in the draft, and leaves even pro goalies stranded in allsvenskan. the way he shoots is beautiful to behold. most players “hammer” the puck to get velocity. he seemingly “caresses” it into a corner at high speed. fluid and efficient with a hint of elegance is how you would describe his one-timer from the side. his wrist-shot is of a similar calibre and equally beautiful to watch. the power he generates defies the ease with which he leans into his stick. that, allied with a great eye for a corner, means goalies often don't get the chance to move. his release is so quick and effortless that if there is even a slight screen the goalie won't even realise a shot is incoming, especially with the proficiency that strömgren has shooting in stride. his strength and willingness to get to the net also means he can do the dirty work in close. his passing is not on the same level as his shot. however, it is not a deficiency. from a technical perspective when he sees a pass he can effect it no matter what the difficulty level. the issue at times is that he does not see some passes that he should. part of this is as he is primarily a goal-scorer, and wants to get to the danger areas instead of waiting for a precision pass. part of this is also likely due to a small degree of “puck-hog” buried inside of him. part of this is likely as while technically extremely proficient in every area his hockey iq is not quite the same level. for a big man the winger has soft, deceptive hands. not only this, he has the confidence to use them. he can manoeuvre the puck in close to any way you can imagine, while in stride. as such, he is also able to use this ability to help unleash his high-end shot, manipulating defensemen to make them stand off, or re-positioning the puck from a bad pass at the last minute from heel to toe to pick a corner. however, there can also be a downside to this. hubris. at times that is what it appears strömgren has with the puck on his stick. especially when playing against men. there were some games where he was a turnover machine due to making one too many moves or trying to dangle past a player when it was not on. he did clean this area up as the year went on, which is a positive, but it will always be in his natural mind-set to take players on, and hopefully he can continue to be more selective in this area. as a forechecker strömgren uses his good skating and reach, alongside his willingness to engage physically, to harass opposition defensemen and make their life hell on the break-out. his extremely active stick at times comes from no-where to disrupt a pass or steal a puck off a stick. he does not seem to be as intuitive as the best fore-checkers in this area – he can occasionally chase too far or get crossed up with own line-mates — but you cannot fault his willingness and work-rate here. with more maturity here with his skating and frame he could be a juggernaut on the fore-check even in the nhl. once on the cycle or protecting the puck down low even fully grown men with 10 years of pro experience struggle to relieve him of the puck. what is confusing at times is his work inside the red-line. he is willing to get back. but in contrast to his fore-checking he does not move his feet enough at times and can get caught puck-watching. additionally, he has been guilty of mis-reading plays too often and getting himself out of position as a result. work ethic here is seemingly not the issue though, it just appears that he can be prone to that “rabbit in headlights” feeling in the defensive zone. this should be rectified with more experience and good coaching going forward, but don't expect the young swede to be ever anything more than “solid” defensively. as you can probably infer from all of the above, strömgren is raw. he has a wonderful set of tools, and he has really started to begin figuring out exactly how to arrange them within his toolbox. if he can continue to progress both mentally and physically over the next few seasons he will be an nhl player. given his skill-set it is very possible that the hulking winger ends up a good second line winger who can potentially hit 20 or more goals a season with some regularity. he will be a good pick-up for a team in the second round of the 2021 draft. profile -- above-average size, skating, and hands -- is always a hit at the nhl entry draft. it's easy to see why. teams want toolsy prospects in their lineups, especially when those players offer an impressive range more broadly. there is an inherent risk with these types of players though. they sometimes struggle to leverage their above-average tools towards a productive nhl career. they also sometimes turn into pitfalls, as has proven to be the case, to some degree, for . the winger's 1-on-1 skills are among the best in this draft. his processing speed and ability to read defenders allow him to register incoming poke checks at the precise moment they are initiated. his reaction time and close-to-perfect technique let him avoid them entirely. and störmgren doesn't only react to opponents; he often dictates their movement, opening them up through creative manipulations, hesitations, freezes, and fake moves before threading the puck through them. like many other danglers, calling card is a bit of a double-edged sword. he treats opponents like pylons in an obstacle course, one he must clear. instead of improving his percentages by attacking space, making give-and-goes, or protecting the puck with his frame -- nhl translatable moves --, strömgren makes defender's lives easier by bringing himself to a glide before engaging them. his success rate in 1-on-1s is relatively high compared to his peers, but it's destined to wane as the talent pool compresses. what gives us hope is that decision-making problems result from untamed ambition rather than a lack of vision. he registers outlets most of the time, and can reach them with a variety of deceptive and skillful passes, and even pull off the occasional give-and-go to create a shooting lane for himself. the problem is, there are too many instances where he looks off his support, teammates in much better positions, to try and piece together a dangle sequence through defensive formations. “the skill is still there; the instant dangles, high reaction-time, deceptive passing and dangling. he also uses his body...sometimes,” elite prospects lead scout david st-louis wrote in a february game report. “you can build an nhl player out of his package of skills, but it won't be easy.” whichever team drafts will have to recalibrate his offensive mentality to coax a productive top-six forward out of this raw collection of skills. he undoubtedly has the skills to fill such a role. his hands, shifty as they may be, have to become just one of the many different cards he plays against the defence. he has to better identify the conditions in which a dangle attempt is appropriate, such as acquiring a speed difference or against an off-balance defender, and developing his pass-and-support game to diversify and increase his offensive threat. one last important element: strömgren might be an above-average skater based on form, but his stride rate and overall pace remain pretty low. he will need to elevate his work rate to complete his to the nhl. big winger improved as the season progressed. nhl size and shot. is a big winger who has a lot of impressive tools, but is still learning to master all of them. he has quick first steps that helps him to reach top-speed effortlessly and he has great agility and puck control which makes him hard for defenders to stop. he's a big winger who moves well for his size. his balance and power stand out. keeps a nice, wide stance when slowing down in the offensive zone to protect the puck. his stickhandling is really strong, an attribute you don't see often on big players. has a direct and powerful style and tries to find solutions by being creative with speed. his speed helps him to create space both for himself and his linemates, and he found his line mates with hard, accurate passes. he uses his size and strength to protect the puck, and this combined with his speed, makes it hard to knock him off the puck. he can make a few impressive moves in a row to put himself in a dangerous scoring situation, but does need to improve his finishing ability and decision making once in those areas. he can play quickly when moving in the cycle or while stationary and moving pucks around with his teammates. has a great release on his shot, it's hard and accurate, and his passes are often that way as well. he can make the no-look cross-ice passes through traffic. he shows some shifts his motor, going in for an offensive chance, doubling back for the puck, and then going in for another chance. however, his effort level is inconsistent. he can coast or skate leisurely a little too often, especially on the backcheck. when he does backcheck, he is active with his stick in both covering areas and chasing the puck. he needs to improve his positioning in his own zone though, as he can be in the wrong place and leave opponents with more space then he should. he can overwork situations and he could be more calm in his play and read the game instead of chasing the puck. he also seems to have issues with his hand-eye coordination, as there are instances where he struggles to receive easy and wide-open passes. he could also use his frame better, as he lacks a physical edge.\n",

prospect without any clear weakness in his game and a lot of high-end elements. he's a great skater with a clean stride and can barrel down the wing with speed. speed is good, not overwhelming, but he's got a fantastic first step and a great overall pace to his game. he combines that pace with very good hands and vision, showing how versatile a threat he can be. he can make creative plays off the flank and sees his options well. it's not just his speed and skill that stand out, but his compete level is elite. is the kind of forward who can dangle around defensemen, blow by them or drive his way through them. he gets to the net, consistently and without fear. he battles for pucks as hard as anyone and typically wins them, even at 5-foot-11. he's not the biggest but that is really the only criticism i can find of his game. has been a top prospect for many years and this season he showed exactly why he's been so touted. u18 coach john wroblewski on : “sandpaper and silk. he's the perfect blend of speed, skill and power. he's kind of a brad marchand type who plays he's got that 1-on-1 ability, he's got a great shot in tight, unbelievable vision and he plays with an edge. his game is predicated on him driving the puck to the net and putting the opposition on their heels. his bravery combined with his speed makes him the player that he is.” when missed much of the first half of the season due to injury, i expected it would take him some time to adjust and find his game after he returned, especially given the way hughes and trevor zegras were playing down the middle for the that wasn't the case … at all. was, from the moment he returned to game action, the biggest driving force behind hughes. there were a number of games when zegras, cole caufield, matthew boldy or cam york would grab the attention. there were plenty of them, frankly. but was the most consistent of the bunch. he doesn't have the finishing ability of caufield or the cross-ice playmaking ability of zegras, but he's a significantly better two-way player than both while remaining an exciting offensive threat as a passer and a shooter. is strong on the puck, powerful when he chooses and careful when he needs to be. add that to the way he fights to win pucks back and keep plays alive and you've got arguably the most complete player in the draft. it has been a winding season for , who was on the shelf with a significant injury the first half of the season and had to deal with a bout of mono toward the end, but when he was healthy, he was exceptional. he is a smart, two-way forward with an unrelenting motor and an ability to make plays in the offensive end of the ice. is dogged in puck pursuit and remarkably strong, despite being average-sized. he is a fierce competitor but does not step over the line very often. he is not always flashy and doesn't always make the eye-popping play, but he makes the plays. goes hard to the net and into the corners, and he has the touch and plus-level vision to make plays under duress and find better options in tougher situations with the puck on his stick. on top of that, has good speed and can make plays in transition. he has deceptive feet, showcasing a good second gear that allows him to beat defenders wide or challenge them inside. although his season was abbreviated by injury, some of his rate stats stand out. he appeared in just 16 games against competition but had 34 points, an average of 2.13 points per game -- higher than hughes. his 1.68 points per game in all competitions for the u18 team was second only to hughes, albeit a distant second. had remained healthy for the entirety of his draft-season, it's entirely possible he'd be a legitimate candidate as a top-five selection across the board. produced at over a two points per game pace against competition with the this season and almost matched those numbers playing against the ncaa.only phil kessel, auston matthews, and jack hughes have matched or bettered that pace over a prolonged sample in the history. , committed to the university of for 2019-20, put these numbers up playing mostly on the second line, behind hughes. as impressive as raw production is, it's even better when contextualized looking at his time-on-ice. when was on the ice at 5-on-5, he produced roughly four points per hour — the best rate from any player, in any league, in this class — and his seal adjusted scoring rate of 1.76 points per game is second only to kakko. there isn't a catch, either. it's not like is giving up a lot defensively. this is a player that's every bit as proficient from his own zone as he is the offensive zone. one scout that i spoke with compared him to patrice bergeron, after qualifying that he hates player comparisons. the speed, skill, production — it's all there. can be a dynamic, franchise centre at the next level if he stays healthy. there isn't any one component of centre game that isn't high-end or elite — i don't throw the latter of those two words around lightly, either, you'll find. he's a highly competitive, two-way centre with elite vision and playmaking ability; a player that has the potential to develop into a patrice bergeron-like player at the nhl level. the only question i have about is whether he'll be able to stay healthy enough to put all those tools together and carve out a highly-successful, long-term nhl career. time has proven that injuries, particularly when a player is this young, are more about luck than anything else, and i'm clearly not deterred as his ranking can attest. has committed to the university of next season, where he'll have every opportunity to play significant minutes, in high-leverage situations, and both phases of special teams. it's the perfect spot for his unfortunately for the badgers, it's going to be more of a pit stop than anything else. game is mature beyond his years, and he'll be able to transition to the nhl in not much time at all. , overall this season, averaged over 2 points per game. this, in fact, was a higher rate than #1 prospect jack hughes. if it wasn't for injury, would have set numerous records this season. has very few flaws in his game if any. he boasts excellent offensive ability and plays a well rounded game. he hates losing and plays with a tenacious flare and high compete level, a level that is considered one of the highest in the draft overall. is likely a year away from nhl duty, but it wouldn't be surprisingly to see him in the nhl late next season. projects as a two-way #1 at the nhl level. a skilled two-way forward, has an amazing top speed that allows him to create many controlled zone entries. he owns great acceleration and agility, which makes him deadly on the breakout and in the neutral zone. though it looks like he's still getting used to his legs, his skating is effective and powerful allowing him to break through contact and drive to the net or down low. with both great speed and puck protection, he passes defensemen on the outside with ease at high speed. he pushes the pace of play and carries the puck through the neutral zone and into the offensive end at full speed. he's big and lanky with a good amount of power that enables him to be a dominant force with the puck. an exciting player to watch, he boasts nice hands and can beat opponents one-on-one with creative stick work. he has the ability to spread the ice and draw defenders over to him, while then firing cross-ice passes to set up teammates for scoring chances. not afraid to be a net-front presence, he shows he's willing to do anything to score and win. he has some filthy mitts and he can pull off incredible moves to create space for himself. he's very competitive and he will battle with intensity for every loose puck. he backchecks with intensity and is very involved defensively.\n",

            " played all season up in the getting limited minutes for one of the top teams in that league. he excited folks when he scored 27 goals in 31 junior games last season. is a high-end passer and shooter. he shows great vision and patience, holding pucks and finding teammates through seams. he shows good creativity on his entries with flashes of top-end skill. he has a very hard shot and projects as a legit mid-distance shooter. the combination of his shot and vision makes him a threat inside the offensive zone and on the power play. off the puck, his game is just ok. he is a physical player who regularly throws his weight around and can win battles versus men, however, scouts criticize his compete level and discipline at times. skating is average as well. his stride looks good but lacks any real power. one of the more polarizing players in this draft, is an unquestionably talented creator who has drawn criticism internally and externally (as well as from team sweden) for his shift-to-shift consistency, skating and commitment off the puck. and while i won't dispute some of those concerns (though i would say they're all various degrees of overstated), he also shows regular flashes of high-end skill with the puck, he's got more room to fill out, he contributed as a teenager in a top pro league, he has always dominated his peers and his defensive results were pretty impressive this season. he was a 53.9 cf% player. lulea outscored their opponents 21-9 (70 percent) with on the ice at even strength. and he did all of his producing at even strength due to spotty power play usage (he was 17th on the team in average power play time per game at 0:47). i would argue his straight-line skating is actually an asset. it looks a little weird. like some others his age, he picks up his stick and pitchforks more than you would like. you'd prefer to see him extending his stick forward in one smooth north-south motion. his stride can look stunted, with his feet dragging through as well. but he creates quite a bit of his offence off the rush and his stride improved as the year progressed. his skating regularly helps him create partial breaks or win races as he does on this late-season goal: he starts low in his defensive zone for this late-season goal off the rush as well (and that release in motion is dangerous): could have real value if he falls (a lot like arthur kaliyev did) because his reputation gets away from him. speed is one of the best in the 2020 nhl draft class. he can light up the jets pretty quickly. speed is one of the best in the 2020 nhl draft class. he can light up the jets pretty quickly. from an aggression/physicality perspective, is not as aggressive as fellow draft eligible prospect, lucas raymond, but he is still is a reliable fore-checker/back-checker. all-in-all, there is a lot to like about . his speed, stride and shot are his strongest components and are only likely to get better. a polarizing figure in this draft class, certainly has the skill to be a higher pick. concerns about maturity and the federation's avoidance of using him at international tournaments have raised some red flags. and his usage with lulea waned as the season wore on, and his impact seemed to head in the wrong direction. but when you look at the skill, release and potential, is a risk that teams are more likely to take in the latter half of the first round. the variance in opinions on lulea winger is about as vast as territorial holdings in 1658, with career outcomes ranging in fortune from the battle of narva to the treaty of stockholm. for the non-history nerds among us, the more dour of those two outcomes, the treaty of stockholm, is a capitulation to the coalition forces they faced in the great northern war, in which they surrendered many of their territorial holdings on mainland europe, particularly in pomerania. basically, they lost their willingness to fight, and that's the first item many scouts cite as a strike against . he's not ceding territory in the literal sense but possession of the puck is another matter, or so the narrative goes. i mean. how else does one explain the esteem or lack thereof in which the scouting community holds ? never mind the federation's unwillingness to use him in any capacity this year. this is a player that stringed together 15 relatively productive games in the during his draft-minus-one season; one who followed it up with a 13 points in 45 games this year with lulea's men's team. there's no denying his offensive gifts. plays with such finesse, such anticipation. where most cleave through their opponents with the precision of a chainsaw while they're forechecking, picks his opponents apart as if by scalpel. he'll hover above the puck and pick off passes if he's the first man in or he'll wield his stick like a hungry hungry hippo from just outside the scrum in support of his teammates as the f2 and leave with possession. he's not afraid of initiating contact, by any means, but it's not his go-to. which brings us to one of his shortcomings -- an unwillingness to take a hit. it's a consistent theme throughout game reports. just doesn't hang in there under even modest physical duress. on the odd occasion when tries to, it's more cute than it is resilient. \" sometimes seems stressed when he is about to get hit and throws the puck away. clearly, it affects his decision-making negatively,\" our dir. of european scouting christoffer hedlund said of in a player report from this season. \"he needs to become stronger on the puck when cha i lenged by direct physical play.\" it should come as no surprise then that creates the majority of his offence with off the puck skating patterns, the ability to find space, and relatively good timing. he's got a great shot, and if someone can carry the puck into the offensive zone or dig it out on retrievals for him -- watch out. the curl-and-release is a favourite of , but that also speaks to his limitations as a sniper. he's not a true one-touch scorer -- the stick isn't supposed to travel against the grain of the puck if you want that label -- and generally struggles to generate power in small-ice scenarios. one of the real strengths of as a shooter is his shot placement. he's able to tag anywhere on net with time and space. if he integrated a little more deception into his release or wielded pre-shot movement to get the goalie going, he'd really be cooking with fire. if he improved as a skater, too? now we're really talking. it's not like it can get much worse. he's got such a wide stride when he jumps from his stance, with a recovery that lands well outside his frame, and an unwillingness or inability to integrate crossovers in space. \"his skating is ugly and he's not quick, especially in small-area situations -- wide recovery, lack of consistent extensions, and for some reason, he never uses crossovers in open ice,\" remarked in a game report. \"you'd think a player with such a flaw open-ice stride and obvious speed limitations would rely more on crossovers. not only will crossovers allow him to get more out of his hands, it'll provide more efficient acceleration/speed generation.\" that he can't handle the puck at the meagre speed he's generating at this stage in his is just a little bit concerning. he'll occasiona i ly place the puck within the defensive triangle, and there are flashes of genuine ski 11, but it's hardly what we'd consider a strength. in the defensive zone, gun i er is just a complete adventure. he's either completely checked out or just a little too invested. he attacks the puck-carrier in a straight line, consistently overcommits, and is easily taken out of the play. the commonality across ever performance, good and bad alike, is that he's not providing much if any value from his own zone. whichever team drafts isn't going to be looking for the next frank j. selke trophy candidate though. they're drafting him to score goals, and there's ample evidence that he can perform that task at an absurdly high level given his age. it's hard to imagine a scenario where makes us look good with this ranking. he'll either explode into a top-six scoring role with utility on an nhl power play or have an illustrious european career. it's hard to imagine just about anything else. he's one of the draft's most fascinating players. my opinion of has changed a bit as of late. analytics minded people tend to like him, and i did at the beginning of the year as well. however, like many players in the swehl this season, has struggled to produce offensively. not only that, but he has also looked one-dimensional at times and has been just okay at international events. however, i think he does have some upside and could be a play-driver if everything comes together for him. i believe he has a higher upside than a handful of players i previously had before him, hence the bump. if there's a shortcoming in game, it's his skating. his top speed is fine, but not high-end by any means. he has a bit of a hunched over stance that that isn't overly efficient, but he manages to reach top speed quickly. this isn't so much a detriment to his game as much as something holding him back from being the best prospect he could be. as he fills out and adds leg strength, his skating will improve. he is not afraid of challenging the defense and he sees the ice well, setting up both forwards and defenders with accurate passes. a towering winger with a sharp mind and a deadly release on his shot. the first thing you notice when he has the puck on his stick is how fluid his game is. he handles the puck just as smoothly and confidently at top speed as he does standing still. his goal scoring ability is his calling card as he has an elite wrist shot that he can beat a goaltender with from almost anywhere. his ability to disguise his release is a true scoring threat and the puck explodes off his stick and hits the target with regularity. his defensive game is average but nothing special. he covers his point, helps in the corners when he needs to, but he could skate a little harder on the backcheck at times instead of hoping to be sprung on a breakaway. massive potential as an offensive catalyst.\n",

            " had a great limited season, scoring two points per game (24 points in 12 games) for the oil kings following his great underage season, although his u18 worlds were good but not as inspiring. is a forward with a lot of nhl attributes. he has great skill, and can make skilled plays through defenders and to teammates at an nhl pace. he can make some plays through seams while also having the shot to score from a distance. he has a lot of talent, but also works off the puck, forcing turnovers and playing in traffic, even if he's not overly physical. in a sentence, may not be a true game breaker in the nhl, but he projects as a top-line forward who will endear himself to fans and coaches. has a multi-faceted offensive package off the flank. inside the offensive zone, his ability to handle the puck in traffic, play pucks into space, and shape and hide his shot all impress. in transition, he creates off the rush using quick crossovers to build speed and weave through neutral ice as a primary carrier. so he's not only capable of transporting the puck and leading the rush, but he then has the offensive acumen to make things happen once the play slows down inside the offensive zone. add in a dangerous mid-range wrist shot, good control of his inside and outside edges, the ability to shoot from a variety of stances and there's a lot to like. though i don't think he's going to be a go-to defensive player at the next level, he also does a good job applying pressure up ice and tracking to support his teammates so that he's a factor without the puck. believe it or not, though, despite his eye-popping numbers in the (24 points in 12 games in 2020-21), there were some times this season in the ajhl (where he was outshone by matthew savoie), and at u18s when i felt like there was some kind of star quality missing from game. i wonder whether he projects more as a second-line creator who can play pp1 than a first-line talent at his ceiling. if you select at the 2021 nhl draft, you are acquiring an outstanding playmaking winger, who possesses the ability to read defensive formations with ease and adjust on the fly. in one of his few games with the sherwood park crusaders, i noticed implementing a pick and roll like strategy at the blue-line, which allowed his teammate and puck carrier savoie to skate to the of . used the pick and roll to distract the attackers. he pulled the attackers to him and opened up wide lanes on the side for savoie to exploit. he will also draw attackers towards him and flip a pass behind his back to a teammate. not only does come up with strategies on the fly to open up lanes, but his ability to deliver passes from range has come in handy at both the and ajhl levels. can fire crisp cross ice seam passes, long range passes from the point to the corners and backhand cross ice feeds from half-wall to half-wall. he moves the puck with ease. an impressive physical presence with great vision, is a production machine. he tallied 36 points in 23 games split between the oil kings, sherwood park crusaders, and under-18 team in 2020-21; 19 of those points were goals. the versatile winger likes to shoot and shoots hard. a smooth skater -- more quick than outright fast -- is a challenge to contain in the offensive zone, with and without the puck. he's going to make some team happy as a top-six/power-play scorer for many seasons to come. drove the edmonton oil kings' first line as a draft-minus-one winger last season, and that had our staff excited for the follow-up. well, jokes on us. is playing for the ajhl's sherwood park crusaders for the time being, where his skill level is so drastically higher than that of the competition it's almost comical. wrist shot is an nhl level tool. he centres the puck and generates more than enough downforce to get more than enough lever action on his stick for a quick-strike wrist shot that ought to find itself on the canadian firearms registry. he's savvy enough off of the puck to find soft ice to release that shot from, too. work rate is almost non-existent at times, and that's concerning, but we suspect that's more environmental than anything. edmonton oil kings winger bullied the albert division last season, scoring 24 points (12 goals and 12 assists alike) in 12 games. that two points per game pace is the best clip anyone's run as a ﬁrst-time draft-eligible skater in the since 1988. stop me if you've heard this before, but we need to contextualize those numbers before getting too carried away. the oil kings were by far the best team, in a tie as its highest-scoring one, and they played in the league's weakest division. played a substantial part in shaping those realities, but there might be some empty-calorie points there, too. i'm also not going to talk you out of being impressed by those numbers anyway. the striking symmetry of those numbers may give way to the assumption that is a dual-threat scorer, but we don't hold to that belief -- not yet anyway. our scouts see the oil kings winger as a sniper who ﬂashed some growth as a playmaker this season rather than a fully formed dual-threat scorer. has every tool necessary to score goals in bunches at the nhl level: one- and two-touch ﬁnishing ability, a wide array of release points, blade deception, and best of all, the skill to get his shot off mid-stride. “[] doesn't drag the puck back,” elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell said of his shot in a march game report. “most of his releases are exploding forward into his shot, increasing power, control, and protecting from backpressure.” there's just no denying the potency of shot. it's already comfortably an nhl calibre tool. he's one of a handful of prospects in this draft who can credibly threaten from range. the sort of player opposing defencemen have to pay just a little more attention to than most. and on top of that, has a real knack for ﬁnding soft-ice off of the puck. he's always positioned to collect the biscuit in the soft parts of the offensive zone, a testament to his goal-scorer's savvy. now, about playmaking. the data that tracked this season may paint his contributions as a distributor in a pretty favourable light, but those numbers don't really align with the tape. though we saw rare ﬂashes of nhl-level passing from , the problem is that they were just that -- ﬂashes. volume-centric approach as a shooter comes at the expense of creating sequences through his linemates, and he often just ﬂat out misses passing options. we haven't seen enough from between the blue lines to conﬁdently project him as an impact transition player at the next level either. so many of his neutral zone rushes are of the straight-line variety, and he's a fairly predictable player as a result. couple that with about nhl average skating and it's just hard to envision a scenario where he's ever going to be a primary puck-carrier. it's not hard to imagine a scenario where thrives in a top-six role as his line's primary ﬁnisher though. jeremy davis' pgps (prospect graduation probabilities system) model grants him a 39 percent ixls (impact expected likelihood of success) based on this season, which is about as well as one can hope to do in this range. that same model gives him a 59 percent chance of making it to the show in a full-time capacity period. we anticipate will hear his name called a fair bit earlier than where we have him ranked. it's a play that could pay dividends for whichever teams stakes their claim to the oil kings sniper. even if a one-dimensional player, his one dimension happens to be the most valuable one in the sport -- scoring goals. though limitations may keep him from the top of an nhl depth chart, they won't keep him that far from it. our scouts project to an nhl second line, and we suspect he'll do just ﬁne as a shoot-ﬁrst winger in that role. there are a lot of questions as to who would come in at number two in my rankings for the majority of the year. at the end of the day, the edmonton oil kings comes in at number two. has been on the radar of scouts for a while now, and this year was no exception. even with limited playing time in the managed a goal-per-game, and then put up another 4 goals in 7 games at the under-18's for team is an absolute sniper, but he is also a well-rounded offensive player. he can run a powerplay and drive play. plays with tremendous pace and creates a high number of high danger scoring chances. can score and create offense both off the rush and down-low through cycle play. he possesses excellent hands and overall offensive instincts. looks like a top-six forward at the nhl level. he is likely a year away from nhl-ready. is an elite on and off puck player who has a wide variety of weaponry that he's capable of showing off. is about as complete of a package you can find in a player but also has room to keep on developing his tools and approach to the game. he's a strong skater who utilizes crossovers effectively to change his routes and gain speed so he can gain momentum into his glide and works well in tight spaces. his ability to make plays through weight shifts and angle his body to protect pucks and move pucks to efficient space so he can make a play is an effective part of his game and is capable of showing off fine motor skills and skill layering. he's a strong dual threat player who is proactive at reading ice to move pucks to space and then timing a route to play off the backs of defenders and manipulating space to jump into open ice to pick up a puck. he's a skilled puck handler who has good body shape when shooting and passing and shows the knack to make proactive decisions and the ability to adapt and solve problems or show some creative edge to his game. he's becoming honed as a shooter and has the ability to open up his body to be a one timer threat and use his wrist shot as a more refined tool where he can quickly collect and pick a spot with some strong mechanics. there are very few weaknesses in his game. isn't a relentless forechecker and while he is often putting pressure on puck carriers, he holds off just slightly; choosing to keep positioning a priority as well. if continues to use power moves to the net by lowering his shoulder and retaining possession, he could be even more dangerous. defensively, there's a hunger to get the puck and turn over play, in which he uses a good stick and sprinkles in some physicality to do so. he can be a bit hasty in getting to some assignments which does leave him in some inopportune spots but the efforts are applauded. moving forward, he will want more attentiveness to detail sprinkled in and use of methodical angles.\n",

            " split time between the and as he struggled to establish himself at either level as a 17-year-old, but he ended his season on a strong note, as he was named the mvp of the iihf under-18 championship. his poor regular season aside, he has a lot of promise as an nhl prospect. players his size who can jet as well as does are hard to find. he's a player whose speed makes him incredibly dangerous, given his long wingspan, and he has great puck skills. he won't be a premier playmaker but is able to generate quite a bit of offense from his creativity, speed and ability to drive the high-percentage areas. his game needs to round out a lot, though. he isn't that great defensively, and though he can play a power game, he needs to work on being more consistent in loose puck battles. blessed with great size and skating ability, a poor wjc tournament for himself and most of the fins has dropped his stock but a monster u18 tourney had scouts salivating once again. he possesses the potential to be a top-end power forward at the next level. is a prospect with plenty of tools in the toolbox as a big bodied, offensive-minded forward who makes an impact when he uses his size and speed to his advantage. he has solid skating ability, with power and balance on his edges helping him transition and pivot while maintaining healthy speeds. he has good acceleration in small areas and opens himself up well for the pass. has impressive puck skills for a bigger player, showing the ability to handle a hard pass and make skilled dekes at high speed. he is a powerful skater who can drive through defensemen with the puck on his stick, protecting it with his reach and strength before making a sharp cut towards the slot for a scoring chance. he has the ability to single-handedly generate chances in the offensive zone. he explores pass options at the time and quickly makes up his mind about when and where to distribute the puck. he is dangerous working along the boards utilizing his large frame and strength to win battles. he's constantly buzzing in the offensive zone looking for gaps and soft spots in coverage, waiting for a pass before unloading a heavy shot. he is very aggressive on the forecheck, leaving his opponents little time to make plays. he has an active stick that he constantly uses to interrupt passes. he is equally quick and aggressive on the backcheck, forcing a couple of early turnovers as one of the first players back. once in the defensive zone, displays excellent positioning, constantly clogging passing lanes and covering the blue line. he shows decent awareness in coming low into the corner to support his defenders in puck battles along the wall. is a player with so much promise and projectable upside, but he doesn't always make a difference on either side of the puck. inconsistent effort has been his big hurdle and what has caused him to slide from lottery consideration earlier in the year to this spot in our rankings. he looks too lax or lazy at times. he has a tendency to glide through cornering and loop around the zone instead of starting and stopping to get pack into the play. his effort and drive must improve so that he can consistently be the guy carrying the play. while his defensive game still needs some work and his consistency really needs to be ironed out, speed, size, and offensive skill should still make him an alluring prospect in a weaker draft this year.\n",

            " impressed early at the junior level this season, earning a quick promotion to playing versus men where he held his own at the vhl and levels and making an appearance with senior team. he was also a top scorer at the u18 worlds with 13 points in seven games. he's undersized and not an amazing skater for his size, but he's done well versus pros because of his tremendous playmaking ability and his ability to win battles despite his size. he can make slick one-on-one plays, creative plays under pressure and find seams consistently. he's physical and responsible defensively. he could be a more explosive skater ideally, but the other elements of his game pop. in a sentence, projects as a top-six forward who will be on an nhl power play. where many gifted young prospects play loose, flowing games that rely on hanging onto the puck and often playing away from pressure until the play opens up, plays a direct, more intentional game. against his peers, that game allows him to attack at and through pressure, create his own chances, and drive play to the inside when he has the puck. when there isn't the same space to attack into or the same openings in coverage against men, his game can really quiet. when he's engaged in the fight and keeping his feet moving, there's a lot to like about his ability to impact a shift (both by ramping up the pace with his skating or slowing the game down to play a little more calculating) in a variety of ways. but i've also come away from some viewings feeling like he wasn't nearly as active or present as he needed to be. he's a bit of an enigma. a strong performance at u18 worlds definitely helped him solidify his stock as a first-rounder, though. is a highly-skilled playmaking winger with a drive for the centre-lane and sound defensive details loves to drive to net-front. he will consistently look to drive to net-front with or without the puck. it doesn't matter if it's mid-cycle or off the rush, skates hard to the net. when it comes to getting to the net, has shown at all three hockey levels (khl, vhl and mhl) that he is more than capable of pushing off attackers, standing his ground and driving to the net without possession of the puck. when doing so, he keeps his stick blade facing parallel to the puck carrier incase the puck carrier passes to him as he charging the net. don't forget that is strong in the defensive zone as well. loves playing tight man-on-man defense and will start to exert dominance in the neutral zone an elite skater with exceptional puck-possession skills, is a natural threat to carry and drive the play in the offensive zone. already stronger than he appears -- and he's got a way to grow in that sense -- the 18-year-old established himself as a potential top-20 draft pick with his strong 13-point showing (in seven games) at the under-18 championship. scoring a goal and adding an assist in his first season in the also turned heads. his defensive effort needs work, but such improvement will come with time. a bit of an agitator, will fill a top-six role in the nhl eventually. just keeps on putting up points at every level of hockey, all the way from the mhl to the vhl and even 12 games of action. i spoke to one scout who likened game to that of rodion amirov. it's a pretty apt comparison, too. is a highly-skilled playmaking winger with a drive for the centre-lane and sound defensive details. he needs to be a little more careful with the puck, though. the superstars of tomorrow -- matvei mickov, shane wright, and connor bedard -- occupied the top three spots on the scoring leaderboard at the u18 world hockey championships. the fourth-highest scorer? , eligible for the 2021 nhl entry draft. he is the most skilled prospect this year. most opponents might tower over the young forward, but it doesn't matter. if you give him space, a runway through the neutral zone, or a pocket in the offensive end, he will cut around the opposition with a combination of rapid handling and crossovers moves. his skating posture is one of the better in the draft -- his knees bend to 90 degrees and advance past his toes -- and there is creativity in the way he uses that superior tool, changes of speeds and lanes to make defenders hesitate. when there isn't obvious play to make, the forward defaults to cutting through trafﬁc with handling moves. it rarely works against better competition. “ was great at corralling the poor passes he received and quickly getting the puck back off of his stick.” elite prospects regional scout dylan grifﬁn said of his performance against the czech republic. “he was attempting a lot of low-percentage passes and dump-ins rather than carrying the puck himself at the beginning of the game, but slowly started to convert to using his strong skating ability to move it. his decision-making was still questionable, though, as he wasn't surveying his options well at all and turning the puck over as a result.” his vision narrows along the boards. he loses track of defenders, imagines them on his back, and struggles to ﬁnd productive outlets. his game lacks a puck protection element, one that isn't based on rapid elusive maneuvers, but shielding abilities that would allow him to make plays inside contact. lack of off-puck abilities also limits his chances of displaying his skills. getting open for a pass isn't a strength of his, contrary to his teammate at the u18s, fyodor svechkov, whose game is based on attacking space and connecting plays -- abilities we tend to value more than pure skill in our rankings. when not directly involved in the play, when not f1 on the forecheck or backcheck or the puck-carrier -- situations in which does show a high motor and some physicality -- he wanders more than he supports teammates, forcing them to do the heavy lifting to get the puck back and up to him. the more structured game and its more physical demands could certainly speed up of hard skills and supporting abilities, but we don't anticipate such a the forward's realistic upside is probably one of a skilled middle-six winger, one who will score more in transition than off the cycle. he will likely need skilled retrievers to maximize his open-ice skill-set. if there is a player who could be a first-round sleeper, it's chibrokov. one of the few 18 year-olds in the didn't look out of place, though he did struggle to put up points. however, his coming-out party was the under-18's, where he managed 13 points in 7 games and his skillset stood out. is a modern-style skilled offensive forward. he is creative, has excellent hands, and is quick. also plays with pace and isn't afraid to dig in the corners or difficult areas on the ice. he has an excellent shot and can play in all situations. ability makes him a difficult player to handle one-on-one. he also has a deceptive shot and an extra quick release that frequently catches goalies by surprise. willingness to engage physically and dig for loose pucks in the corners makes him a well-rounded offensive player. even with his small size, isn't afraid to take on larger forwards to cause turn-overs, a trait that will serve him well at the nhl level. there are some questions surrounding ceiling. some scouts have him pegged as more of a third-line nhl winger. however, with his combination of quickness and overall offensive skill, i believe has the potential to be a top-six scoring winger at the nhl level. he is a few years away from nhl duty. is a fantastic skater who often displays very good top speed while carrying the puck on his stick, using fluid crossovers to generate speed through the neutral zone and find space in the offensive zone. with lightning acceleration and sublime hands, he is a real threat in transition. give him too much time and space in open ice and you've got a huge problem on your hands. he as the wheels to beat opponents wide and gain that all-important separation. he's also quite an elusive player, able to slow the pace down, shift his weight seamlessly from side to side, and deceive defenders with his hands, feet or head movement. he shows poise with the puck on his stick and calmness under pressure. he finds his teammates with passes in motion and can maneuver the puck into better shooting lanes. he does a good job of spotting opportunities on offense, finding teammates with crisp cross-ice passes while skating on the perimeter in the offensive zone. he also shows a willingness to go to the front of the net to make himself available for deflections and attempt to screen the opposing goaltender. at both ends of the ice, compete level is impressive for the most part, keeping his legs churning and playing aggressively on the forecheck in order to make life difficult on opposing defenders on the breakout. but his effort level and intensity can cut in and out, as some shifts he can dominate the play, but others where he blends into the scenery. his defensive game can be quite inconsistent. though can appear to be engaged with the puck in his own zone and shows a willingness to keep his feet moving, there's something to be desired in regards to his defensive positioning and awareness. there is a disconnect with his ability to read and react to the play in his own zone, which leads to him running around in his own zone a bit too often and prolonging defensive zone time at times where proper positioning could have potentially broken up passing plays. in addition to inconsistent defensive reads, there are also times where is guilty of flying his own zone too early in an attempt to stretch the ice, making breakouts more difficult for his defensemen.\n",

            " impressed at the junior level before their season was canceled. his pro and u18 worlds had good flashes but not consistency. has very good stick skills, is able to deke through checks frequently and create a lot of chances with his skill. he can create off the perimeter with his playmaking, finding seams and making creative passes, but his shot is more dangerous as a legit mid-range weapon to pick corners. works off the puck and creates turnovers with his effort. his main flaw for the nhl is the lack of nhl speed and ability to pull away from opponents. in a sentence, projects as a bottom-six nhl winger. is a play-driving, versatile winger with a standout wrist shot, who pushes tempo through neutral ice with a compact stride. he makes a lot of smart, aggressive plays inside the offensive zone, and can process the game at speed. when he gets the puck, he's looking to take it at defenders and attack the inside. but there's also variety to his game and when the play to the middle isn't there, he has demonstrated a knack for being unpredictable, so there is a creative flair to his game. recent viewings (both before and into u18s) did leave me feeling like he was missing the defining skill needed to turn a b-plus prospect you take in the 20s-40s into the a-minus one you'd consider in the teens, though. so we have a young player with a booming shot, a good two-way game, plus skating and good hockey iq… but what are the issues? the main aspect of his game that needs improvement to reach his potential is his decision making when on the puck. he has a tendency to take to much time to make a play for a player with a seemingly good hockey iq who both understands seams on ice as well as defensive coverages and opposition goalies it is also slightly concerning that often misses clear high-danger passes. a skilled puck-handler and effective physical presence, is most admired for his vicious and accurate shot. strong on the puck, he doesn't shy away from confrontation in the dirty areas. the imposing winger scored nine goals and 11 assists in 15 games with skellefteå's junior team, and earned a 22-game run at the pro level. another round in the will help further season game. his skating could use some refining. has a wide array of shots in his arsenal and isn't shy about pulling the trigger either. they're the weapons around which might build an nhl career. he wants to play a high-paced, rush-style of offence, but a propensity to drop his head when pressured could limit how far that takes him at the next level. there's a nice collection of tools here, as checks out with average or better tools grades almost across the board. our group was optimistic about coming into this season, but we most of our viewings wanting to see more from this winger. is your typical jack-of-all-trades winger. when he was on his game last season, there was a lot to like. he just wasn't on his game all that often. even so, some distinctly positive qualities revealed themselves in the good and the bad viewings alike. his shot, in particular, is an nhl-calibre tool that he isn't shy about leveraging against unsuspecting goaltenders. he's got the full array of weapons at his disposal: snapshots, slap shots, one-timers, wrist shots, one-touch ﬁnishes. it's all there. he pushes his top hand from his body and fully engages the lever-motion downforce on his stick for a mechanically clean shot with plenty of zip and accuracy. it's easily the most projectable tool in his toolbox. couples that shot with savvy off-the-puck timing to make him a consistent scoring threat in the offensive zone. and he's really great at using the threat of his plus-level shot to open up passing options; it's one of those instances where his strength in one area opens up possibilities in another. elite prospects dir. of north scouting mitchell said it best in a mid-season game report, “he's more dangerous without the puck than with it.” whether that's a compliment of play off-the-puck or an indictment of his play without it is the big question. we'd call it a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b. the problem is that doesn't really plan many of his touches or register the position of opposition defenders before the puck lands on his stick. if he's not immediately collecting the puck for a shot, then the game starts to move a little too fast for him to keep up, and he's soon out of options and without possession. it's not necessarily a pace issue so much as a vision one. just doesn't seem to catch most opportunities to create through his linemates with give-and-goes or one-touch passes unless they're blatantly obvious or directly in front of him. “he needs to reﬁne his offensive habits, pre-scanning, his awareness of his space, of defenders, and increase his pace,” elite prospects lead scout wrote in a february game report. “but when he has his options in front of him, he uses them, give-and-gos, cross-ice passes, and changes the point of attack to reposition inside space. he plays more like a scorer than a playmaker, more at ease hunting those openings than creating passing seams.” may not project as a dual-threat scorer, but he's going to ﬁt into the nhl as a two-way forward. he's probably one of the better defensive wingers in the entire draft. our partners at instat hockey tracked time with skellefteå in the last season, and the results were pretty staggering. ﬁnished with a minus-seven shot attempt differential at 5-on-5, but he ﬁnished with a plus-18 unblocked shot attempt differential. the takeaway? skellefteå may have suffered a slight deﬁcit in overall possession when was on the ice, but they didn't give up much in the way of threatening looks. the hope for whichever team drafts is that some of the skills he ﬂashed in his draft-minus-one season will become a permanent facet of his game. you couple that with an nhl-level shot, strong defensive habits, and a high-level work rate, and you're cooking with ﬁre. the top of an nhl lineup might be out of the question, but has all of the tools and gumption to hang in a checking depth role. that seems like the baseline for , and anything extra is found money. is an excellent two-way forward who has middle-six nhl potential. an elite skater with a high compete level, is constantly aware of his surrounding in all three zones. he plays a simple game that scouts love. there is a low-risk element to his game, which some teams will love. he is a player without a ton of flash, but he can play anywhere in the line-up and make those around him better in all situations. there are portions of his game similar to the likes of mattias janmark and calle jarnkrok, though he is potentially a better skater than both players. some scouts have questions surrounding ability to produce offensively at the nhl level. he struggled in top league on the offensive side. however, this is an area that will likely come with time and increased opportunity. projects as a middle-six forward at the nhl level. he will need a few years of before he is nhl-ready. is a big and heavy winger who plays with a lot of power. as a typical power forward, he is not afraid to play physical and get into dirty areas. he is also very strong along the boards and uses his strength and size to protect the puck when carrying it in both acceleration and high speed. has a high-end motor and three-zone awareness, helping him to be effective all over the ice and on every shift. he applies tons of pressure on opponents with his pace and focus, and with great routes and positioning, whether that's deep in the offensive zone or high in the defensive zone. he contributes consistently, from stealing and winning pucks to killing penalties. handles the puck very well in stride and likes to challenge opponents and he is a threat in every shift when he moves over the offensive blue line. has a high hockey-iq and knows where he has his teammates and when to pass the puck or when to hold on to it. he often makes quick decisions and opens up the game with diagonal passes through the zone. he shows great creativity and offensive awareness in attacking the middle on first touches, which create openings for himself and his teammates. he plays inside the dots on offense and looks for deflections. has powerful strides, which helps him reach his impressive top speed. his agility really helps him to change skating directions quickly, which makes him especially hard to defend against when entering offensive zone. he has a fantastic flow in his feet and shows great balance. his shot and his ability to always be around goal scoring opportunities make him a constant threat. he has a quick release, it's very hard and he shoots the puck with accuracy. he can make some dangerous shots and passes, but isn't particularly elite at either. his passes are accurate and hard, without being a trait that truly stands out. he throws his body around from time to time, though he doesn't have the muscle mass to be a physical difference-maker. could improve his defensive game by showing more urgency when defending. the swede is a very well-rounded prospect that will likely be carried to the next level by his competitive nature and ability to contribute in all three zones.\n",

            " had a fantastic season in playing significant minutes in the country's top league and showing flashes of dominance versus men in and at the world championships. has a ton of skill in his game. he's got the high-end hands to make plays through defenders and the cute dangles that will make highlight reels. can make the real tough passes and makes a lot of great decisions, but his creativity is what impressed me most. he improvises very well, with the high offensive iq to know how to create offense versus men. has good size, and he's not afraid to lean on guys. he's not a crash and bang type, but he protects pucks very well, he takes pucks hard to the net and he already showed that he can power his way past pro defensemen as a 17-year-old. his speed is just average for me. he's not slow, but his skating is not the selling point of his game. despite average speed, he gets inside to the net so well because of how fearless and strong he is. could be an impact forward in the nhl, whether at the wing and possibly even at and should transition quickly into that role. tps manager antero niittymaki on : “his stick handling and overall skill level is one of the best i've ever seen at his age. we put him on the top line early in the year, and even though he was this young, skinny guy, you could see away he's strong with the puck in the corners. he's really balanced on his skates. it's tough to knock him off the puck. since the world juniors, he was dominant in regards to (his physical play). he can hang onto the puck as long as he wants. he's nhl ready.” while hughes was playing at under-18 worlds, was playing friendlies and practicing with national team ahead of the senior world championships after an excellent five-game, four-goal performance in playoffs. in the final three of those games that i tracked, he averaged 22:36 time on ice and attempted 17 shots. is that rare blend of power and creativity. he can use his strong, extended stride to build momentum and drop his shoulder to drive the net but he can also feign the net-drive play only to make a deft pass to a teammate. is also lethal from the right-wing circle (where tps used him on the power play) and gets low to leverage his one-timer and extend through pucks, which gives him a different kind of game-breaking talent than hughes, even when he's not playing well. both of his final two goals of the playoffs came from that spot. here's that one-knee one-timer i was talking about. and here's his standstill shot, which can also beat goalies cleanly, as well as a flash of his stick handling ability (and some impressive footwork) to evade the pressure. needs to correct the pitch-fork he has developed in his straightaway stride but he has all of the tools needed to be one of hockey's dominant wingers. your eyes did not deceive you at the world championship. already plays at a high level with and against pro-level players. after he recorded the third-best scoring season by a u18 player in history, it was not a shock that he posted six goals and an assist for gold-medalist only patrik laine had more points at a world championship as a u18 player. there's so much to love about game. he has a great frame and uses it well, as he's hard to take off the puck and uses that ability to create extra time for himself to find plays. he has the vision to spot those plays and make them quickly, and i think his hand skills have gotten to a fringe elite level. his shot is high-end and heavy; he can beat goalies from distance, but then he also has the skill to make plays in tight at the net front. although not hughes-like in his skating, he is powerful and has enough speed to break away from the opposition. his edgework is strong, and his balance makes him so difficult to play against. he has power, but he does need more explosiveness in his skating. battles as well as any player, both in puck pursuit and with it on his stick. there's a definite fire in him to compete, and he will be a cornerstone nhl winger. only mikael granlund and aleksandr barkov have produced more offence on per game basis than in the men's league, is a dynamic player with the puck on his stick, capable of dropping his shoulder and driving to the net or methodically cutting through defenders one move at a time, avoiding contact entirely. it's that creativity that makes such a unique offensive threat. the goals-heavy point split and skill-set lend themselves to the belief that he's a goal-scorer first and foremost. one of the surprising developments of game this season has been his ability to create offence through his linemates. loves to set up shop below the goal line, and from there he does a fantastic job of warding off defenders and finding teammates for grade-a scoring chances. in fact, in the sample of players i've tracked, has among the highest scoring chance assist numbers and is completing 80 percent of his passes — for context, hughes is completing 85 percent of his. plays like these have helped form the notion that could, potentially, be a centre at the nhl level. i'm not sure that i'm quite convinced yet. i'd need to see perform at a high-level down the middle for an extended sample to believe it. then again, i'd hate to bet against the guy either. is the leading point producer in his class by theseal (situational era age league) adjusted scoring rating, also developed by davis on canucksarmy. he might not possess the ceiling that hughes does, but i anticipate that transition to the nhl will be a smoother one in the short-term. the list of skaters to produce as much or more than did last season in the as a first-time draft-eligible skater is two players long: mikael granlund and aleksander barkov. using seal adjustments on scoring rates him as the most productive player in this year's draft, with 2.05 adjusted points per game. there isn't a better player in this year's class from below the hashmarks than . i'm not sure that there are going to be many in the nhl either. what lacks in straight line acceleration and two-step quickness he more than makes up for his with balance and agility on his edges. he's near-impossible to push off of the puck, and that comes in handy when one spends as much time in tight to the opponent's net as does. he's adaptable with the puck, threading the needle through traffic to feed his teammates grade-a scoring chances or driving to the net-front himself. as far as consolation prizes go, one can't hope for much more than at second overall. he's going to be a capable middle-six winger in the nhl from day one, with the potential to become an elite, play-driving, first line winger in the years that follow. i also suspect that he'll have an easier time transitioning to the nhl than hughes, at least in the short-term, for whatever that's worth. was a revolution this season. he was ranked by many to be a top 10 pick before the beginning of the year, and he had solidified his number 2 ranking by christmas. is a powerful goal-scorer. in fact, he broke florida star alex barkov's record for most goals by an under-18 player in top league. also tore up the world championships, scoring another 5 goals against a high level of competition. is also a relentless forechecker and is almost impossible to knock off the puck. only knock at times is his speed, but he makes up for his lack of top speed with elite hockey sense. he projects as a franchise winger. look for to be in the nhl as soon as next season and make an immediate impact. a deceptive presence who's really slippery for a player of his build, doesn't have any major flaws to his game. his speed is an underrated feature, considering it's his hands and overall goal-scoring abilities that most scouts rave about. a very noticeable player every time he hits the ice, he skates very well and shows flashes of up-tempo speed. his top speed has improved a lot and his mobility is great for guy his size. he does a good job of shifting his body to change attack angles and although he sometimes shows some naive tendencies to overhandle the puck, he has the ability to put an accurate touch on his passes. displaying spectacular puck skills, he's strong in the corners and has shown that he's a beast physically. his ability to do lots of small things with the puck is a tremendous asset. he can take hits and keep his balance, which is why he wins a lot of puck battles. he likes to use his size to his advantage and he's tremendous when protecting the puck. he needs to improve his overall consistency to be a difference maker shift to shift and fill out a bit to play a heavier game. having put in a lot of work in on his game over the past year, he's more than ready to take his game to the next level.\n",

            " ice time was very limited playing versus men in but he has impressed in international play the past few years; however, a shoulder injury sidelined him for a big chunk of the season, and may have hampered him in season. his skill level at his size is incredible, as he makes tough offensive plays seem easy. can stick handle in open space, but he also excels as a playmaker and can make the smart play when an option is available. there's the odd time he can get caught trying to do too much, but often he reads the ice well and can make the decision. skating isn't high-end, but he skates well for a player his size, showed significant improvements during the course of the past year and could be average as a pro. his off-the-puck game is fine too. is a polarizing figure; he can dominate a shift with his size and skill and then go dormant for games at a time. the fact that he refused to come over the north america despite being the top selection in the import draft only adds to the fear of the dreaded ‘russian factor'. a boom or bust pick. is a power-forward who has high-end possession skills. he moves well, especially for his size. while not a burner, he moves up and down the ice with healthy amounts of speed, is very strong on his feet and has a wide balanced base. his stride is deceptive in that he isn't always churning his feet but can still gain separation from defenders. he is a thick kid, with nhl strength who uses his size to dominate along the wall and down low. his hands in tight are impressive, as is his quick shot release that he can muster off in motion or use from afar to challenge goaltenders. his ability as a sniper and power-forward sometimes overshadow his all-around ability and skill as a playmaker, but make no mistake -- he can distribute the puck with skill and touch. he is a gifted puck-handler who likes to dance through the offensive zone by changing directions quickly and making swift turns with the puck on his stick. with his strong puck protection skills, he often manages to drive the net from the outside without giving the defenders any chance of separating him from the puck. he loves to have the puck on his stick and carries it with great patience, often waiting for the perfect passing moment. he has a good understanding of his positioning in the offensive zone, rotating with his linemates smoothly and gaining body positioning in front of the net. he is engaged and physical. in his own defensive end, he shows the understanding that he needs to come down low in his own zone to support his defenders and to apply back pressure. with all the positives in his corner, high-end skill, impressive size and strength, there is a reason he has slipped on most draft lists. for every good shift he tends to produce, he opts to take the lazy route and not work along the boards on some pedestrian shifts, letting his teammates go to battle for him while he waits in the reeds for pucks to squirt out. there is also some lackadaisical efforts put in when coming back defensively with the play as consistency seemed to elude him. lastly he is fiery in the physical game but at times acts like a dough head after the whistle getting his team into penalty trouble for selfish retributory reasons. this big kid with allworld skill seems to have some maturing to do to reach his full potential.\n",

            " without an season, went to slovenia and was also one of the top scorers at the u18 worlds, despite limited minutes at times. is a highly intelligent player who can make tough plays consistently. he has the small-area skills to make checkers miss and the vision to make plays off the flank and under pressure. he competes well enough to win puck battles even if he's not overly physical. his skating is elusive, with a decent first step and ability to 10-2 around defenders, but he lacks separation speed. his toolkit doesn't scream “first-round pick” and he's listed higher than where my eyes think he should be due to just how much he's shown he can score at various levels. in a sentence, projects as a middle-six nhl forward who may frustrate a coach if he doesn't score. game is archetypal of the way the game is trending. he's a slick, creative puckhandler and facilitator who manipulates set structures to create lanes for himself, slicing pucks through and around feet and sticks. he's also light and airy on his blades, with skating mechanics around quick cuts and adjustable edges more than straight-line power. he's an entertaining, puck-dominant east-west player who thrives when he gets a lot of touches. and while his decision-making with the puck can be a little suspect at times (and resulted in a brief benching during his otherwise impressive u18 worlds), he's diligent without the puck and projects as a centre long-term. if you like fun and flashy hockey players, you will appreciate . has shown throughout his time with the kitchener rangers and hdd jesenice that he can be a dominant force in all three zones. he is a defensively responsible forward with a quality shot in medium danger. on loan from the kitchener rangers to hdd jesenice in the

seven contests. a play-driving and innovative puck-handler, thrives in the offensive zone. but he's only a so-so skater who needs to work on his explosiveness and acceleration. still, with further and improvement, the tools and on-ice smarts are in place for to serve as a top-six at the nhl level. we're sticking our necks out a little bit with , but in a year like this one, why not? rachel doerrie, who scouts the for us, gave a rousing endorsement for , and that's good enough for me. however one defines hockey sense, got the stuff in spades. he works with a great understanding of timing and spacing in the neutral and offensive zones alike, and always makes the play with the puck. it sometimes seems as if has everything mapped two or three plays ahead of the competition. he needs to play with more pace, but has all the trappings of a playmaking centre. was one of the most difﬁcult evaluations for our group this season, and that's really saying something considering the circumstances of the 2021 nhl entry draft. we started the year with at no. 6 overall, placing a bet that his pace would catch up to his well-above-average offensive instincts and tools. that just didn't happen, which changed our calculus. the kitchener rangers product ﬂew from the uncertainty of the for the guarantee of playing time in a professional setting with the slovenian-based hcc jesenice of the alpshl. his skill level was ever-present, and he used it to amass 11 points in 13 games, but his pace remained sluggish. “ was trying to force plays or do it all himself,” elite prospects scout lauren kelly wrote in a march game report. “his style of play, the habits that worked well in the haven't seemed to translate overseas -- and i did ﬁnd it odd that his teammates rarely wanted to give him the puck on the power play. don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about skill set -- it just seems like there's a bit of a mismatch here.” so, we had to drop pretty drastically in time for the u18 world hockey championships. must've noticed. he went to frisco and plano, texas, and played perhaps the best hockey of his budding career. his work rate soared to new heights. he picked up the pace. he even battled through a little bit of adversity, overcoming a third period benching early in the tournament to play a critical role in helping secure the gold medal. we've more or less split the difference between the two rankings, and that suits us just ﬁne. you just can't drop a player as skilled as any further than this. certainly not in this draft. he's a dual-threat scorer in a class with few prospects who conﬁdently project as much of a singular scoring or shooting threat at the nhl level. the foundation of potency is his hockey sense. he supports his teammates, takes optimal routes to prepare one or two plays in advance, always ﬁnds soft ice in the offensive zone, and times his movements perfectly into those pockets of space to strike. with a no-drawback push release, he's sending the puck home as a capable one- and two-touch ﬁnisher. a gifted setup man, has a wide array of playmaking arrows in his quiver. he'll attract defenders to within his orbit to create space for his linemates, work the give-and-go, and conceal his intentions until the puck ﬂies from his stick. he'll use weight transfers, fakes, freezes -- anything to keep the opposition guessing. some of those same qualities make a pretty serviceable defensive contributor when he wants to put in the work. he tracks well through the neutral zone, makes well-timed interventions in the defensive zone, and takes good lines on loose pucks. the problem is, effort level comes and goes at his leisure. all of those strong defensive habits don't count for much when he's not loading his stride off the puck and making half-assed attempts at collecting loose pucks or contributing in board battles. it's not like has the physical tool kit to be an overwhelming force in any of those scenarios anyway. he's not particularly strong on his skates and pretty easy to keep at bay along the boards. his rounded posture, and a lack of ankle ﬂexion limit his explosiveness as a skater to such a degree that he's never really going to be the ﬁrst to a loose puck either. at this point, i hope you understand why we'd keep a player with such dynamic offensive qualities so relatively low on our board. there are quirks to game that could keep him from playing regular nhl minutes period, much less skating in a team's top-six. he would hardly be the ﬁrst skilled, heady, dual-threat scorer to ﬁnd his prospects of an nhl career undone by a poor work rate and a lack of pace. you just don't pass on players with offensive bona ﬁdes at this point in the draft, though. because if everything works out, that's a top-six scoring winger with power play upside. is a bit of a puzzle, but i firmly believe he will be a solid nhl prospect and player. a victim of the canceled season, excelled at the under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games, and looked dominant at times playing in europe this season. is a versatile, offensive forward. he can play all three forward positions and can easily move up and down a line-up. more of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, is extremely aware of his time and space in the offensive zone, making him a constant threat. he is an excellent passer and while he isn't a shoot-first player, his shot is also above average for his age. some scouts question whether or not he has an extra gear offensively, or if he will be a perpetual support-type middle-six forward. if all the pieces come together, could be a middle-six forward at the nhl with some offensive upside. is an incredibly and dynamic offensively gifted forward. an electric puck possessor, it's nearly impossible to tell what is going to do next when the puck is on his stick. highly deceptive with his use of his edges, twisting and winding through traffic and finding open ice where there seemingly is none. also does a good job of keeping his head up and scanning his options while carrying the puck. he can make sharp passes through tight seems and is incredible at finding those passing and skating lanes. edgework and overall skating abilities are fantastic. he's dynamic and deceptive, and he showed an ability to be able to effectively utilize the 10 and 2 skating style to deceive opponents in different areas of the ice. he makes really tight turns and can change direction on a dime. he utilizes weight shifts to move quickly around defenders, bursting with some speed as he adjusts his pace on the fly. the fearlessness he shows is impressive. he constantly tries to push through traffic, sometimes it pays off, other times he puckhandles himself into a turnover. he has no problem bringing the puck into small-spaces, but getting out is a little hit and miss at times. he has a nose for open space in the offensive zone, using quick edges and light feet to quickly drive the net after sliding behind a defender. his hands move so quick with the puck, matching his feet, however he can get stuck with his head down when in a tight spot. he seems to always be looking for the lanes to the net, quite often finding them. he shows his commitment to the defensive side of the puck as well, often the first forward back and getting deep to help his defenders. he'll also hang back when his defender has jumped up in the rush. there are cases where he needs to speed up his processing as he can hold onto the puck for a little longer when trying to evade an attacker. often shows a willingness to support pucks low in the defensive zone, but can get caught skating with his stick in the air, limiting his ability to stop and disrupt plays and allowing easy passing lanes around him. playing in slovenia, had a strong season playing in a professional men's league.\n",

            " this is a pretty high ranking, but it's slightly lower than i expected i'd end up slotting earlier this season, as he looked like one of the greatest czech prospects in recent memory. he's one of the few czech players to ever play as an under-age player for their under-18 and under-20 teams, alongside michael frolik and jiri hudler. there's a reasonable best-case scenario with that he'll become a top-end winger and i'll end up cringing looking back at ranking him too low. is a shifty player, with very good speed and a nice first few steps. his defense could use work. he also can try to do too much and be selfish at times. the most troubling thing with is that his seems to be flattening out, and a downward trend is always a red flag, so there's also a non-zero chance that he busts. is an offensive-minded winger looking to make a difference on the scoreboard each and every game. he is a pretty good skater, showing an outstanding burst of speed with the puck through the neutral zone and into the offensive zone. shifty and hard to contain as he is just as quick laterally as he is going forward. does a good job creating offense away from the puck, utilizing his ability to slink around and get into open position for scoring chances. grade-a shot, especially the velocity, but accuracy is also good. he has a good backhander, too. however, there's aspects to work on in this department. sometimes he seems to hesitate when given a good shooting opportunity. also, he needs to improve his one-timer consistency. he's also inconsistent when it comes to passing. some days he's really good at it, other days he just can't fnd an open lane. can make hard, accurate passes both in the neutral zone and in the offensive zone. his attitude to the defensive game was fne as he supported the defensemen pretty well. good forechecker, too. physically, he is not afraid to go to the gritty areas and pay a price for a scoring opportunity. thrives in a go-to role for his team, but he needs to realize hockey is a team game. again, consistency in effort levels wanes from contest to contest and shift to shift. he looks downright lazy in some contests. he gets stripped of the puck too often. can be prone to turnovers when he tries to do too much on his own, engaging multiple defenders and trying to beat them to the net with one-on-one dekes and jukes. needs to read the situations better and realize he cannot do it alone; he will need to learn to utilize his teammates better with give and goes, cycles in the offensive zone and just short, quick passes. defensively, he shows very little interest in that aspect of the game, only half-heartedly coming back and remaining in the general vicinity of his check. he reacts late in the defensive zone too often. can get frustrated easily and that really knocks him off his game. he needs to mature in his understanding of the game and his role in it.\n",

            " generated buzz when he made his czech pro team as a 16-year-old and held his own. this season he looked good but not spectacular versus men, and, after a solid world juniors (especially for a u20) he came to the and was very good in the second half. checks a lot of things you want in a hockey player. he's quick, he's skilled, he can make difficult plays and he can score goals. he's also a competitive two-way forward who can kill penalties and win battles. i do have a mild upside question given he's not that big and lacks truly high-end skill, has had a lot of games i've seen over the years where he's just not that impactful offensively and fades into the background. even if he's not a game-breaker at that size, he has enough elements to his game that he could make it and help a team. the more i watched as the year progressed, the more i fell in love with his skill set. he's got pop to his game that almost all of the players ranked after him lack. after putting together some spectacular age-adjusted seasons in the czech republic, he stepped into the and became a dynamic goal-scoring threat quickly, even if you account for his 22 percent shooting percentage as unsustainable. he plays a straight-line game that could probably use more of an east-west element (particularly in the way he involves his teammates) but he can crack open a shift with the puck on his stick, he's quick from a standstill and he does a wonderful job finding soft spots in the offensive zone to get open. watch below how he rotates off his defender and swings from behind the net to the slot. he does a great job drifting away from pressure before sneaking back into it and finishing high off his backhand: and though his game off the puck still needs work, i think he handled the adjustment to his defensive responsibilities on the smaller ice fine. it bears mentioning that the bulldogs struggled as a whole defensively this season, so it's no surprise that there were some growing pains for him. some scouts have criticised his skating, but there is no doubting his speed, and alongside his hockey iq his skating is amongst his best attributes. the concerns though more around the “process” of his skating than results though. myšák is a great goalscorer. both from wing and when he has played down the middle. his skill and speed allow him to get the advantage through the neutral zone, his hard forechecking style ensure he is rarely far from the puck, and his hockey-iq allows him to get in great positions to score. made the jump from czech professional hockey to the and it allowed him a better opportunity to showcase his full set of skills. is a very strong skater with good offensive instincts. he averaged over a point per game with hamilton, and there is some two-way value, as he shows good effort at both ends of the ice. does a lot of things well but doesn't have many elite traits. why not start the second-round with a bang, by leading with one of the draft's most polarizing prospects, hamilton bulldogs centre . his statistical profile, at least coming into this season, was the sort that commands first-round attention, at the very least, and a spot in the first 15 picks most often. seven points in 31 contests represent the 14th-best season by a draft-minus-one skater in the czech men's league, and it's the fifth-highest point-per-game rate in the last 20 years. even the first-half of 's draft-year in the czech extraliga held promise; his point-per-game rate is in the top-five among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the league's last 20 years and compares closely to carolina hurricanes centre martin necas at the same age. you'll be hard-pressed to find someone in the game who rates accordingly though. \"you'd use a first-round pick on that guy? i don't see any high-end tools and he's only an average skater,\" a western conference scout told us in december. some of the industry sources we consulted with told us they wouldn't even bother using a second-round pick on . we're a bit more bullish on than many of the scouts we spoke with. there's a nice collection of skills in his game, and he's a great kid with an unrelenting motor. summed it up pretty well in a game report from february, saying of , \"he has some projectable offensive elements -- vision, ability as a passer off the rush, and the ability to pick corners, but he will need a lot of change to his game if he wants to play in the nhl.\" he's a north-south attacker, one who skates a fair bit better in our estimation than the league gives credit, but a fairly rudimentary one at that. often attacks in a straight line, doesn't often integrate the dot-i ine, and doesn't set up his maneuvers especiaily weli -- it's a very meat and potatoes style of attacking. another area where excels in the offensive zone is as a forechecker. he takes smart routes to the puck, funnels opposition defenders towards support, and anticipates play well generally. it's when offensive zone possessions become more static that his abi i ity to impact the game wanes. 's not an especially mobile player off of the puck, and he often struggles to find his linemates consistently as a distributor, much less connect on difficult passes through layers. there's no denying statistical profile -- it's pretty special. then again, so was pavel zacha's going into his draft-year. the new jersey devils would probably feel a lot better about zacha if they took him 32nd-overall rather than sixth. you'll hear a lot from certain more statistically-inclined corners of the hockey world that has a high-ceiling, but we're not convinced of as much. that's okay. you're not going to find many first-line calibre talents at this point in the draft. the long-term play with is likely that of a third-line checking winger with penalty killing value. made the jump to the at the midway point of the season. after struggling to produce in the czech republic against men, i was curious to see what he could do against his peers. hasn't disappointed. is a speedy forward who loves to create offense off the rush. he also has excellent hands and an uncanny ability to throttle his speed to confuse defenders. he is a unique player and is fearless in tight. i see him as a scoring winger at the nhl level. an energetic winger who can make an impact with his speed, tencity and quickness. he moves through the offensive zone fluidly, finding open ice to create dangerous scoring chances. his shot is high-end with a lightning-quick release and he can change the angle with his unique puck work. his hands are quick and controlled, both in-tight and with space, which allows him to open passing and shooting lanes. although he is not the biggest forward, he is good at finding ways to the net through traffic. quick and shifty with the puck, he can change directions quickly and will make opposing teams pay if given the space due to his quick hands and slick puck skills. he brings loads of energy and an intense compete level to the game and constantly keeps his feet moving, which makes him a dangerous forechecker. sometimes he wants to be too involved, which takes a lot of energy, but his work ethic is always on display. he always wants the puck on his stick, which makes him dangerous in the neutral zone as well. he protects the puck well through the middle of the ice and is tenacious on loose pucks when he doesn't have it. in his own end, he can sometimes get out of position and lose his man but when he has the puck, he protects it well. a player that understands the game extremely well, possesses high hockey iq and isn't afraid to get physical.\n",

            " didn't join the as a top prospect, in fact, he was on the bubble to make the team. a sudden growth spurt combined with a great skill level spiked his prospect stock. is a unique winger in how he plays the game. his combination of puck skills and hockey iq are among the best in the draft. his hand-eye coordination is off the charts. pucks stick to him. he's also incredibly creative and made some of the best passes i saw all season. i wouldn't call him a natural playmaker, though; he prefers to play below the dots and around the net rather than qb a power play. while he's a great passer, has a quality shot and was often used as a trigger guy from the slot. consistency was an issue this season. when competing hard, he's often catching unsuspecting players on the backcheck and gets to the net to score. however, he had stretches this season where he didn't impact games, and sometimes they were long stretches. his main weakness over the years was his skating. i think it's improved to an average level, but he's not a powerful skater and his stride could be cleaned up. u18 coach john wroblewski on : “ grew from 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-2. his trajectory has been steep. he can be a power forward. he has excellent hands and vision. he can finish, he can run a power play, he can be a net-front guy. the puck is attached to him.” biggest skill has quickly become being whatever the national needs him to be. last year, that meant being the u17 team's go-to offensive winger when caufield played for the u18 team. this year, it meant being a jack-of-all-trades. on some lines he became a slot-option scorer, on others he became a forechecking passer. by year's end, on a new line with turcotte and bobby brink, he was exposing teams as the third-leading scorer at u18 worlds. versatility is a tremendous asset. he put up big numbers without getting the offensive opportunities afforded to a player like caufield. though lacks the high-end speed of many of the players near the top of this draft, i wouldn't say his skating holds him back because he does such a good job finding space and getting open (he doesn't need to blow by a defender for a breakaway in order to generate). and alex newhook are going to complement each other extremely well at next season and i wouldn't be surprised if either of them are one-and-done. grew nearly 4 inches the past two years but never lost the puck skills and creativity that he had when he didn't have the size. he is a wing who plays more like a a true 200-foot player who is as valuable defensively as he is offensively. that toolkit is rare, and he's only going to get better as he continues to get stronger. could afford to improve his skating some -- he does not have breakaway speed -- but he still gets around the sheet effectively. in the offensive end, has higher-end puck skills and creativity. he can make the plays in small areas and has an excellent, heavy, accurate shot. also possesses excellent vision and an ability to make accurate passes off the backhand and forehand. his versatility and consistent effort mean he can be plugged in just about anywhere. there is so, so, so much to like about hew game. you want a power winger? can drop the shoulder, pick up speed, and drive the net with his 6-foot-2 frame clearing all in his path. you want a distributor? as many have pointed out, reputation was once that of a playmaking winger. you need a sniper? lovesto shoot the puck, and with good reason — that wrist shot of his is hard to stop. unlike some of the other high-profile wingers in the played mostly with turcotte or trevor zegras as his pivot — he spent little time with hughes. in some cases, had to be the player that stirred the drink on his line, and he seemed to relish the role. is an active puck-carrier, eager to transition play through the neutral zone, and capable of making plays at speed. there isn't much that winger hew can't do. he's a highly-effective offensive winger with size, standing at 6-foot-2, and fantastic hands and puck skills — he's especially proficient on his backhand, as noted in this article for ep rinkside. the biggest concern with game is that he's not the greatest skater, which limits his ability to play the power game anywhere near as effectively as he could if he had an extra bit of pep in his step. if he can sort that out in time for the jump to the nhl, though, has the potential to do a lot of damage in the professional ranks. similar to cozens, possesses an excellent combination of size, speed, and skill. more of a goal-scorer than a playmaker, uses his strength down low to consistently create scoring chances. he also isn't afraid to use his excellent shot to attempt to score from the slot and off the rush. big shot is his calling card. his biggest need for growth is in well-rounding his game and being more consistent overall. projects as a top 6 goal scoring winger at the nhl level and will likely be nhl ready in two years. a versatile offensive forward, possesses elite vision, an excellent first pass in the offensive zone as well as high-end skating ability. he has some slick, deceptive edges and a smooth stride that help him escape pressure with ease. he protects the puck well, thanks to his strong edges and good strength. his ability to consistently enter the zone with control and speed helps his team hold onto possession of the puck and maintain pressure for solid periods of time. his stellar passing abilities are a big part of his game. he looks like he will develop into a top-line playmaker at the next level and could be lethal as the set-up man on the power play, but he can also carry his own in the goal-scoring department. he has smooth hands that make him dangerous in one-on-one battles. he has a powerful wrist shot and a good backhand shot that he loves to use near the net. able to maneuver in high traffic areas with the puck on his stick without losing possession. with his big frame, he can take the puck to the net and screen goaltenders effectively. also displays nice net-front presence as smaller opponents don't have much of a chance to win positioning battles against him. he's decent in his own zone as well, as he is very involved in board battles and covers his man well.\n"
