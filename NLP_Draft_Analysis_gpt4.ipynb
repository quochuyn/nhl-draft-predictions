            "corpus first 5: [\"is a potential franchise-changing no. 1 prospect. his skill and shot are legit game-breaking attributes. his ability to beat defenders one-on-one is among the best i've ever seen by a 17-year-old, and the pace at which he displays that elite skill is going to allow him to execute those types of skilled plays in the nhl. is a highly imaginative puckhandler and a very creative passer. that, combined with the fact his wrist shot is a top-tier nhl weapon from anywhere in the offensive zone, makes him a projected nightmare for nhl coaches to stop on the power play. the only downside to his game is his frame, which has some scouts wondering if he gets pushed off to the in the nhl. he isn't a pushover though, as he plays hard and has a physical edge in his game. given his success as a junior his strong skating and his high compete level, i think whoever drafts him will have to try him down the middle and move to the if it doesn't work. if he is a he could still have a potential patrick kane/nikita kucherov type of impact on a franchise. ’s statistical profile speaks for itself: 28 points in 15 games as a 15-year-old in the two points per game at u18 worlds as a double underager, 51 goals and 100 points on a dreadful team at 16, six goals in four games at u18 worlds as an underager for a second time (in what wasn’t even his best hockey), 13 goals and 31 points in 14 world juniors games (after forcing his way onto the first of those three teams by torching the selection camp), and then, as a 17-year-old who won’t turn 18 until july (we can almost forget that!), a 100-goal draft year as the chl’s leader in goals per game, assists per game, points per game and shots per game. i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: can do things with the puck that nobody else in the sport can replicate. i’m not talking about him compared to other prospects in this draft. i’m talking nobody. as in, you could put him on the ice with the world’s best shooters and they wouldn’t be able to load up just off of their lead skate and fire it off balance like he does, or drop it into their feet and let it go like he does. he’s got one of the best shooting actions in motion i’ve ever seen. the way the puck explodes off of his blade almost without any forward motion to indicate the shot’s coming is remarkable. while that bent-sideways cannon that he has off of his hip is his defining quality, it’s not the only tool he has that is singular, either. in fact, it’s not even the only element of his shooting arsenal that is one of one. his release is lightning-quick. there’s the pinpoint accuracy from impossible angles. there are the little delays and stutters he uses to create separation and get to his spots. there’s his variety of shooting stances (right down to his curl-and-drag, his one-timer, and his feel off of his backhand). he’s got everything else you look for in a dynamic play creator as well. he’s got unbelievably quick hands and the loose grip that all great handlers have. he’s got high-end speed with his galloping crossover strides and strong acceleration from a standstill, which help him carry the puck up the ice, create one-on-one off the rush, or join in transition as the trailer whenever he has to play catchup. he’s also highly creative despite his goal-scoring tilt. even though the goalie is his focus, i wouldn’t say he tunnel-visions, and there’s a lot to his game between the offensive-zone blue line and the shot he takes that’s inventive. he has also learned to use the attention his shot gets as a tool to open up his passing game and find linemates at the backdoor with blind passes through seams. he regularly makes difficult plays as a passer, demonstrating high-end spatial awareness and often finding second or even third options (constantly pre-scanning and shoulder-checking). he’s an entry machine driving play through the neutral zone and across the line in control. he goes to the front of the net and will bail out to make effort plays. add in instincts off the puck to get open even when he’s a marked man, an improved physical engagement (he’s really quite feisty and competitive), some underrated skill as a puck thief, a strong lower half, and you’ve got a superstar prospect. nobody can defend his inside-out cut into that low, hard wrister of his at the junior level. it often takes two to take the puck off of him when he’s twisting and turning, too. he’s a marvel, with legit 50-goal upside at the next level. i think he’ll stick at centre, too (it was nice to see him at 53.6 percent in the circle this year). i’m not sure there has ever been a player ’s age in the history of hockey who has been able to shoot the puck like he can. he can get a little ahead of the play, and he’s got work to do on his game defensively if he doesn’t want to get hemmed in at the next level, but those are things you live with when it comes to talent as singular as his. is an extremely gifted generational offensive talent. whichever team is lucky enough to have the lottery balls fall their way will be sprinting to the podium on june 28th to draft . ’s innate scoring ability is one that we haven’t seen in along time, and i could see as a challenger for the 50-goal mark in most seasons he is not hampered by injury. chicago won’t be challenging for a stanley cup in the next couple years, and the continuous losing may spark a commitment to the defensive side of the game for him, like we saw with mcdavid a few seasons back. one of the most naturally gifted goal scorers to enter the draft, is so much more than a shooter. his offensive intelligence and vision are standout traits which maximize his offensive output. he exploits defenses with higher-end puck skills to create more space and then can finish plays with precision that so few players are capable in this age group. in the nhl, you have to finish your best chances. finishes the ones he’s supposed to and the ones you can’t expect most players to make. the shot is as good as i’ve ever seen at this level. it’s quick, accurate and he can get it off from anywhere in any way, with unmatched precision. is by no means a perfect prospect. at his size he can sometimes get outmuscled and shut down, but he doesn’t back down from physical challenges and has gotten better at asserting himself and playing the body. his skating is good, but not at an elite level to create separation, which is why his hands and creativity have become a big part of his game and how he creates offense. none of the flaws or limitations he has have held him back in any meaningful way at other levels, and i don’t anticipate they will in the nhl either. there are few players that come along where you think every time they have the puck, something is going to happen. is one. he is a threat every time he hops over the boards. is the premier prospect in the world. he has done the unthinkable time and time again over his junior career and will continue that feat in the nhl soon. an electric finisher who blends dynamic skating, exquisite handling, vision, and determination. he’s not the biggest player, but he’ll be a big-time player. this is a generational talent who will change the face of the chicago blackhawks.\", \"there's so much to love about nhl projection. he’s got a huge frame, skates well and competes very hard. he wins a lot of battles and isn't shy to use his big frame to lay out opponents. he has game-breaking puck skills and will be able to beat nhl opponents regularly with his puckhandling, especially given his speed and wingspan. his playmaking isn't the main thing that gets you excited about his game, but can make difficult passes and has strong enough sense to create chances in the nhl. his shot is also a threat from range. that he can create with so much pace is what makes him exciting from an nhl perspective. he checks every box and projects as a no. 1 on a good nhl team. is a big, strong, powerful who takes pucks from the wall to the interior with force, ease and speed — the kind of player every team covets. he can beat you along the wall on the cycle. he can beat you carrying the puck in rotations around the perimeter of the offensive zone. he can beat you by pushing through lanes to the middle third, driving the net, or dropping a shoulder to take space that isn’t there. he can beat you flying out wide. he has regularly blown me away in viewings these last couple of years (at hockey canada’s showcase two summers ago, in games where he looked like a man among boys in the and again at various points throughout his historic, hobey baker-winning freshman year at michigan). and even at 6-foot-2 and about 195 pounds, he’s one of the best skaters in this draft. it’s not often we see players his size who can move like him. his skating is balanced. it’s powerful when it needs to be and light and adjustable when it needs to be. within his movement patterns, he can handle the puck on a string and shade opposing defenders off his hip. he’s going to be a transition monster. on top of it all, he’s physical, he’s a fiery competitor, he’ll get after it on forecheck and track pucks, he plays with energy, and he’ll pounce on turnovers and be opportunistic. he can score from midrange consistently with his low-kick wrister and one-timer, he’s got an ability to protect the puck in and out of coverage, he’s got a dangerous curl-and-drag wrister, and he’s comfortable in traffic. when he’s on, he can completely take over a game. he also shed some of the force-it plays this year that could frustrate me and others at lower levels (he made better decisions on shot selection, overhandled less, and utilized his linemates better). i think he’s going to play in the nhl next year and be successful on raw ability from the jump. and i wasn’t deterred from that belief by his low point totals at men’s worlds. once he refines and rounds out his game some more and adds more muscle as he ages, watch out. has every tool that an nhl team would dream of having with their top overall selection. he’s got the physical tools of size, strength, speed and lateral mobility. he has amazing puck skill with the ability to do it at full speed and in small area situations. he can protect the puck, put his shoulder down and power through a defender, or put it under a defender’s stick and put them through the spin cycle. his vision is high-end with the ability to find lateral teammates and move defenders out of passing lanes to open up new scoring opportunities. he has a heavy wrist shot and a dynamite one-timer. the power play could run through or he could be the trigger man. a 6-foot-2, 200-pound power with touch, is the kind of player teams are desperate for–skilled size. while the league continues to go more towards skill, players that have size, strength, physicality and speed will always get longer looks than their smaller counterparts. in ’s case, he’s also one of the best offensive performers in this draft class. with powerful, quick skating, gets up and down the ice as well as anyone. he’s hard to move off pucks and difficult to slow down in transition. if you time your check you have to hope he’s not going to bowl you over. there’s an aggressiveness and tenacity in ’s game that can overpower the opposition and lead to him winning a lot of battles and one-on-one plays. he’s most dangerous around the net and he gets there with regularity. his ability to drive to the middle of the ice may be one of his biggest separating factors among other centers in this class. meanwhile, he’s producing at a near historic rate in his first season, drawing comparisons to jack eichel’s incredible freshman campaign in his own draft season. has the skill to make a ton of plays. sometimes i question his puck decisions and forcing plays to the middle when they’re not there, but he has good reason to be confident in his ability. the size, the speed and the skill make one of the draft’s premier players and, as we wrote not so long ago, way more than a consolation prize. a fantastic consolation prize, would be the first overall selection in many years. a power centre with the ability to score from distance, matchup against skill, and drive play into the middle of the ice. plus, he’s a serious weapon on the man advantage. this is a draft-and-play asset.\", \"is one of the very best first-year draft eligibles i've ever seen from inside the offensive blue line. he has truly special offensive skill and hockey sense. his mind operates differently from other players in how he sees the play develop and he always seems to find ways to figure into scoring chances despite not being the biggest or fastest. his mind is special, but he's freakishly skilled with the puck too, and can make elite stickhandling plays seem routine. he can make plays at a high level, but is a finisher who will score a lot of goals as a pro. his skating is more elusive than fast and i wouldn't call him a high-compete type either. he’s signed in the through the 2025-26 season, but he projects as a game-breaking elite scoring winger in the nhl. is the best prospect since alex ovechkin and evgeni malkin back in 2004. on talent, upside and pedigree, his game checks all three boxes. the combination of ’s position (nhl teams definitely think twice when drafting wingers this high) and the increasing uncertainty around russia’s invasion of ukraine and his contract in the with could complicate where he goes on draft day, but he still belongs here. and despite suffering a lower-body injury in a preseason game, (who played to a goal a game last year in the mhl) played to a goal a game in russia’s second-tier vhl and was extremely productive for his age after the move to sochi in the (he actually led a lowly sochi team in scoring in his time there). if he were a little more committed off the puck (which i’m not as critical of as some others), and an inch or two taller, he’d have a near-perfect profile for me. he’s different than bedard in tools and approach. ’s brilliance comes primarily from his ability to make his decisions quickly and execute on them with incredible proficiency, whether that’s ripping a patterned shot (his one-timer, his standstill wrister, his curl-and-drag, etc.), a flash of his unbelievable hands, a quick move into a pass, a sudden stop-up, or an attacking cut. but he’s also sturdy for his size, which allows him to extend plays when he needs to, hang onto pucks when a quick attack isn’t there, or delay for his linemates. and while he shines in moments more than long stretches of dominant play or prolonged carries, those short moments and the consistency of his execution within them (despite being freakishly talented, he makes very few mistakes with the puck) create a uniquely high-reward, somehow low-risk game despite his tendency to come and go. when he tries things — and he often does — he’s never trying them out of desperation but rather intention. he’s a rare kind of player where he’s got a-grade tools across the board but he’s also got an efficiency to his attacking that is incredibly rare for a skilled player (especially one his age). he’s not the hardest-working player defensively, nor the fastest skater, but he always seems to be lurking around the play (and the puck) anyway and his skill level pops from there. i expect him to crack games open at the nhl level and while he’s not going to be a driver, per se, i don’t think he’ll fade either because he doesn’t need time or space to attack and he’s a threat as soon as the puck touches his stick (similar to nikita kucherov). a smart, dynamic goal-scoring winger, dictates play when he’s on the ice. with constant delays and changes of pace, baiting poke-checks to freeze defenders just enough to get by them, making up for his lack of a high-end top speed. making give-and-go plays all along the ice, using his teammates effectively, he’s not afraid to turn back in transition in order to maintain possession and open up new opportunities. he finds open ice extremely well and always positions himself to be a great passing option in the offensive zone. all this is designed with the end goal of creating space for himself in dangerous areas to let his lethal shot fly. he may look small, but he’s not easily knocked over, and he doesn’t shy away from physical battles; his physical game has improved a lot over the course of the season as he’s gotten stronger, and it should improve even more from here. there are flashes of great playmaking ability, but it’s not consistent; his ideas and vision are great, but the execution is often poor. overall, since moving teams, he’s been playing a much more projectable game, and not trying to do everything himself so much, which was an issue before, as well as playing a much better defensive game, though it’s still not a strength of his. he has the potential to be a game-breaking talent, but it’s not a guarantee, although i’m less concerned than i previously was. for the last few years, i’ve described as a genius-level hockey player. his sense for the game is among the best i’ve seen since i’ve been evaluating prospects. bedard might be the best goal scorer, but is not terribly far behind. what makes special is that he’s always thinking a step ahead. he uses his creativity to find space, but just about everything he does is intentional and net-driven. the quickness with which he figures out how he needs to get open or how he can best position a shot is at an elite level. in addition to processing the game at such a high rate, also has the hands, and the shot, to execute with precision. currently playing in russia’s second pro division, is averaging a goal per game. for as good a player as he is, he still lacks the strength and quickness to be as effective at the level as everywhere else he’s been. that will come eventually, though, as he gets stronger. this is also what makes his hockey sense special, because he knows how to maximize what he is physically capable of and can outthink his bigger, stronger opponents. whatever team drafts knows they probably will not see him until the 2026-27 season at the earliest, which creates inherent risk in the pick and changes the dynamic of the decision-making process. this isn’t simply a hockey decision anymore. but you can also ask the wild if kirill kaprizov was worth the wait. a team that is confident in their ability to get him signed when his deal expires as well as one that has the ability to be patient has a chance to get one of the best prospects since alex ovechkin and evgeni malkin went 1-2 in the 2004 nhl draft. statistically, is *another* first overall level prospect. the manner in which he produced in the this season is the stuff of legend. a shooter who has never met a puck or a situation that he didn’t lean into. he’s developed a highly advanced playmaking arsenal as well. the 5-foot-11 winger’s biggest knock is his birth certificate and contract status. his offensive upside is second only to bedard.\", \"has elite skill, which when combined with his frame and a strong motor, has allowed him to be a very good player in a great league as a draft eligible. routinely shows the ability to beat pro defenders with skill. he gets a ton of chances in the high-percentage areas, both due to his hands and his willingness to attack the net. he's an excellent playmaker as well with a very imaginative offensive mind who can run a pro power play and often played the flank in the on the man advantage. his only drawback is a lack of true separation speed. i've seen worse feet on a 6-foot-3 guy, but he won't be turning nhl defensemen around. he's mostly played the last two years but has enough experience at and the traits to play the middle that i could see him become a legit no. 1 in the nhl with star upside. though he doesn’t play the game with some of the shine of the three players in front of him, had a tremendous age-adjusted season between his play with orebro in the (including in the playoffs), at the world juniors (where he was one of sweden’s top forwards despite playing sick/banged up), and then for the senior men’s national team for the first time (a team he is now the youngest player to ever score for), even considering his december 2004 birthday. this all came a year after playing to virtually two points per game at the j20 level (he looked good in an important role as a top-nine centre for at u18 worlds before an injury kept him out of their medal-round run to a gold medal, too). ’s a big kid who has begun to come into his body (he’s 6-foot-3 and 198 pounds), but he’s also got slick handling and finesse for a forward his size, regularly finding his way through traffic or around it by out-waiting defenders one-on-one in shielded puck protection off of his hip. he stays on pucks, he’s got great instincts and takes smart routes around the ice, he’s sound positionally, he applies pressure off of the puck and comes up with possession despite not being very physical, and he just always seems to be involved in positive things inside the offensive zone. his skating also continues to improve (he’s not fast, but he’s an above-average skater for his size by my measure and it shouldn’t be preventative in him reaching his nhl upside). his long stick can limit him catching and handling pucks in his feet at times, and he doesn’t have a great shot, but those things should come, he’s got soft hands and standout finesse skill as a passer, and he’s got great dexterity and reflexes all told. ’s also one of the smartest players in the draft and understands spacing and timing on and off the puck at an advanced level for his age. and while he played almost exclusively as a winger in the the last two seasons, came up as a centre and i like the way his game might fit there long term because of his combination of size, detail, talent and awareness. he projects as a pass-first playmaking centre with a middle-six floor, first-line potential, and clear pp value (in multiple roles, too, because he’s great around the net and below the goal line passing low to high, but can also run it from the flank). has been played extremely well at the level this season for örebro. in the offensive zone, he will take over the cycle and will move laterally quickly to shift away from pressure as he sees that if he moves laterally he will skate into a quality passing lane that he can exploit. ’s vision and stick-handling can get him out of well-pressured jams in all three zones. he will find quality passing lanes in the neutral zone when looking for a teammate in stride to pass to and has no issue with maneuvering the puck around tight pressure. hunts for loose pucks with speed and has the physicality to deliver quality checks along the boards to cause puck disruption in tight board battles. is a prospect that we see being a reliable playmaker and playing in a line one role at the nhl level. the buzz is growing (and rightfully so) that belongs in the top-tier of this draft, or at least deserves to be spoken in the same sentence as bedard, michkov and fantilli. has all of the measurable qualities teams look for in a power forward, but he’s shown very early on in this season that he’s got the game to go along with it. he’s been scoring at an extraordinarily high-rate for a u19 player in sweden’s top pro league, while averaging top-six minutes and showing an ability to drive play. at 6-foot-3, 194, he’s a solidly-built forward who is difficult to move off pucks and has good net-drive ability. also has soft-touch skills with the puck and makes confident decisions when he has it on his stick. off the puck, he competes and is responsible at both ends of the ice. he might not have the outright offensive creativity of the three players ahead of him, but he has good hands and good touch on the puck, which makes him extra dangerous in tight. oh, look, another first-overall talent. shone brightly against the best professionals in the 6-foot-3 centre boasts all of the traits you look for in a front-line pivot. won’t wow you constantly, but does everything very well. big, strong, quick, skilled. we like him a lot.\", \"has a ton of creativity and offense in his game. he makes high-end skill plays routinely, he's one of the better passers in junior and projects to be a major asset on an nhl power play. lacks ideal size at 5-foot-9, but he's relentless in puck battles often coming out with the puck despite his frame. he's a responsible, detailed defensive player who is an asset without the puck. his frame, combined with a lack of separation speed, is a concern, though, for his nhl projection even though he's got good quickness in tight. there is a fair amount of risk on his projection, but his strong compete and tremendous skill plus track record of scoring, makes you think there is still a very good chance he can become a quality top-six in the nhl. there were a lot of nights last season, on an ice team that boasted half a dozen of the better forwards and two of the top defencemen in the where this kid was the best player on the ice (which included him leading them in scoring in the playoffs with 23 points in 15 games) as a 16-year-old. and this season there’s no doubt: though an injury kept him out of the first round of the playoffs and allowed teammate matt savoie to really take over in the postseason, was the best forward on arguably the chl’s most talented team at forward this year. and while he benefits from playing with talented linemates, ’s a driver in every sense. he’s a multi-dimensional forward who has quick acceleration, can handle the puck at speed and change tempos in control, can shape play by opening up his hips to go heel-to-heel, thrives in traffic, is a triple shot-deke-pass threat, plays one step ahead of the game in possession, supports the play effectively, problem-solves as well as anyone in this class (in an age group that is full of intelligent playmakers), works hard off the puck to keep his energy up (he plays heavier and scrappier than he looks, too), and sets the pace and effort level for his line (whether by picking it up or slowing it down to use his creativity). he’s the kind of player who fills the stat sheet and elevates his linemates in subtle ways. increasingly, i’ve been impressed by his agility in and out of breaks and cuts (his skating is an almost underrated asset for him and particularly impressive through his edges and crossovers, though he can get going the length of the ice, too). he’ll make plays to the inside from the perimeter on one shift, and then go to the guts of the ice to make something happen in a congested area the next. when you package all of that skill with a dogged work ethic that keeps him around pucks all the time, you’ve got a tremendous player. if he were a little bigger, he’d be a scout’s dream. i think he’s going to be a top-of-the-lineup player regardless. while i don’t necessarily see reaching the top of the superstar bucket, (tavares, kane, stamkos etc…) i do envision him being a cornerstone piece for the franchise that selects him this june. when thinking of a player comparison, i get drawn to a few different players. from an offensive skills standpoint, i personally see a lot of similar traits to cole perfetti. great vision, feet always moving, and just very technically sound with every movement. has a motor on him though that never stops running. to me, very similar to watching brayden point roam around. there just seems to always be a certain intensity when both of them are on the ice and hunting down pucks. both great at carving out pockets of space, and tremendous at distributing or finishing plays themselves. an offensive dynamo with deft scoring touch, has been a key player for one of the best teams in all of junior hockey over the last two seasons. surrounded by talent, continues to stand out as a play-driver with a strong finish. in this draft with a lot of bigger players, stands out in other ways, especially his offensive intelligence and ability to execute consistently. the primary concern about a player of s' size is his skating. it’s fine, but could be better in order to calm some of the concerns about his size. what alleviates the skating concern for me is how quickly processes the game and his commitment to playing aggressive off the puck and in pursuit. he takes a lot of pucks off opposing players in a given game. that competitive drive that he has on top of the ability to make a ton of plays during a game should allow him to continue to be an impact player as he progresses up the ranks. some people are worried about selecting a 5-9 forward without blazing speed at this juncture of the draft. i’m not one of them. has the highest work rate in the class. he boasts high-end puck skills and a plus-rated release. his playmaking is ultra-supreme. this is a worker bee with first-line skills. sure, he may have to move to the flank, but we still bet on these types of guys.\"]\n",

            "is a player who's been hyped for a few years, playing well for and halifax. he had a tough season with a blood clot keeping him out for a while. he came back in late february, but it was still mostly a lost season with so-so production. on the ice, is a fantastic skater who can lead a rush and close a gap very well, and he projects to be able to handle the nhl speed easily. when he hooks the net and is able to rush with speed, he's very difficult to stop with his size. the question on his game among scouts is whether he has enough skill and offensive iq to move the puck at the higher levels. i think he does, but i understand the concerns and debated between putting a 55 or 60 on his hockey sense. he may not be a top puck-mover on your blue line, but rather someone who is solid defensively and makes enough plays to take even strength shifts. it was hard to get a read on this season. he played on a (rare) bad team in halifax and battled injuries throughout. he has always been a top prospect and has long played with a maturity you don't often see in 16- and 17-year-olds. but he didn't really get the opportunity to progress like much of his peers, his game plateaued when he was in the lineup and i'm just a little hesitant to project him one way or the other these days. i'm just more confident in the players who are ahead of him here. he was excellent a year ago and i wouldn't fault a team for considering him late in the first round or early in the second. there's nothing about his game that will really grab you but he does everything well. i'll be keeping a close eye on him next year. he's a hockey favourite, so if he gets off to a strong start, he'll probably be on team for the world juniors. season was derailed by a blood clot, and after he returned, halifax was a decimated team, and he struggled to find his game before the season was canceled. on ability alone, has first-round-caliber talent. but in a practical sense, teams are going to need a lot of assurances of his health before pulling the trigger on an early pick. his hockey sense is exceptional, and can get involved at both ends of the ice, although i'd grade his defensive value more favorably than his ability to produce. if not for a blood clot, might have been higher on this list. however, even when healthy, his point totals are down a bit from what i expected at the beginning of the season. , like poirier, boasts a strong offensive game. he is an excellent skater and enjoys rushing the puck. he is unlikely to be a top pairing guy but looks like a second-pairing defender at the nhl level. a smooth puck-moving two-way defenseman, he possesses great speed, agility and puck control that helps him move the puck up the ice with no effort. with pressure on him, he lowers his stance to protect his puck while still gaining tremendous speed, which makes him almost impossible to stop in the neutral zone. he displays an exceptional rush defense, closing the gap quickly and shutting down many rushes with big hits along the boards. he has an incredible gap control and lateral agility to stay with his man and protect the slot. he also uses his frame and long reach to control his opponents and push them on the outside. he positions himself very well in his own end and he cuts passing and shooting lanes effectively. he showcases tremendous strength in board battles, and he loves to finish his checks with power. he has very precise breakout pass, a smooth stride and moves the puck up the ice with ease. he excels at escaping pressure from forecheckers with good fakes and smooth turns, showcasing a good mobility. he rarely pulls any flashy dangles, but he still owns some very solid puck skills. with a powerful slap shot and a precise wrist shot, he can get pucks to the net often. he is not the flashiest defenseman, but if you take a closer look at him, you can see that he always makes the play. he plays like a with a mix of poise, confidence and great decision making.\n",

            "played a ton of minutes for the soo, and while his point totals may not jump off the page, he was a driving player for that team and lined up in all situations. is a very smart defenseman. his skill won't jump out to you on the ice, but he makes a lot of smart plays at both ends of the ice and has the occasional high-level offensive flash. he's a very good defender due to his iq and his physicality. he kills a lot of rushes and projects to play tough defensive minutes as a pro. the main knock on him is just fine mobility. i don't think he's slow, and i have seen above-average flashes of speed from him over the years, but quickness isn't what makes him interesting from an nhl perspective. this is a ranking i worry about regretting. i agonized over where to rank . he's definitely in the same tier of d prospects as the handful of defenders who rank directly ahead of him here. he's got a real case as a late-first/early second-rounder. the strength of game is his ability to defend players on the breakout and stretch the ice as a passer. i grew to appreciate the role physicality plays in his game defensively, too. he plays a hard game along the wall and if you can live with some of the penalties that come with it, it makes him an effective man-on-man option who can assert himself over the course of a game. he became a big driver for the greyhounds defensively. he's also got some nice deception to his game (look for the shoulder fake below) from the blue line in: i saw him make some great plays off the rush this year, too: my concern with game, if i had one this season, is that on a team with a trio of other defencemen with some offensive skill, he never managed to make himself the clear-cut go-to guy for offensive zone usage. to be comfortable in taking a player in the first round, i want to see them separate themselves from their teammates. we'll see. if there's a theme among many defensemen in this draft, it's underwhelming offensive upside but strong overall hockey sense. that's especially true for , who plays a mature, poised game and takes care of his own end well. he has the size, physicality and mobility to make things tough for opposing forwards. reads the game well, and that aids him on offense, but i don't think he's going to be major point producer. once considered an offensive-minded defender, he was relied on to anchor the defensive responsibilities on the blueline in the soo this season. his defensive abilities are solid and there should be more offensive to give. is a missile on the ice and constantly engaged in the play. while his skating is slightly above average and he has a smooth stride, his biggest downfall is his acceleration and foot speed. that said, he can keep up with the play and doesn't get beat to pucks often but when in a foot race with a speedier forward, he relies on cutting into the forwards path, which could lead to interference calls against him. he doesn't shy away from throwing his body around, despite his thin frame. his hockey sense is strong as he seems to know where he has support and when he can take a chance. whether it's pinching into the zone or stepping up when defending the rush, he understands when to take a risk and when it's unnecessary. when defending in-zone, he does a good job of skating into position and not giving up ground, especially to opposing players in front of his own net. decent puck skills and vision from the back end, but he prefers to move the puck with crisp passing rather than try to skate it out of his own zone. offensively, he has a bomb of a shot and not only is it powerful, but he is accurate and understand the closer he is to the net, the more effective his shot will be. he loves jumping into the play and put pucks to the net. he is an all-around combination of size and skill and plays with impressive poise.\n",

            "started the season in junior but quickly moved up to the level, logging significant minutes and getting power play time as a 17-year-old. is a great puck mover, showing high-end iq moving the puck and ice in his veins under pressure. sometimes he's a little too calm, letting guys close in on him and trying to be too cute, but typically he's efficient on zone exits. he's smooth with the puck, but has very quick hands, and is able to make plays through defenders from a standstill and off the rush. there were several times this season his game popped with a wow-caliber skill play. for a smaller guy, his game could have more speed. his skating looks fine when he winds up and get going, but he lacks explosiveness and doesn't have a ton of pace in his game. despite his size, he's a good defender. he closes gaps very well due to his iq, using his body and stick to break up pucks, and makes a lot of stops. is one of those players who will surely go higher than my ranking but whom i've watched a lot of in order to make sure my differing view of his game is grounded, hopefully, in reality. his stride is nearly flawless. his blades hardly touch the ice when he's extending through his body in straight lines, they're feathery on his crossovers laterally and he's nearly as fast skating backward as he is forward. because he's also really physical for his size, that skating ability allows him to play a tight gap defensively and close on forwards to lay hits along the boards in the neutral zone, forcing dump-ins as a result. though his shot isn't hard, he does a good job using his feet to get his wristers through and he isn't afraid to open up for the one-timer (something i would argue he uses too much on d-to-d plays at the point when a more effective pass is available). you can see both that shot and that neutral zone aggression at play here. my only major concern with game is one of upside. there's no question he's ahead of his peers but two major issues persist: he loses a lot of board battles due to strength and he doesn't mitigate against that effectively with his stick (though that can be taught, which is good). i don't see enough high-end playmaking ability to his game to view him as more than a second-pairing defenceman at the nhl level and i'm not sure his power play use in the will translate to the nhl. a remarkably poised and mature defenseman, spent much of this season playing in the professional ranks. before suffering a concussion at the under-18 world championship, he showcased his puck-moving talent and high-end hockey sense. however, i don't know that there's anything in particular that stands out about aside from the way he thinks the game. the skill is fine, the passing is good-to-great, his shot is ok and he gets pucks out of the zone well. he might be a jack of all trades but a master of none. hockey sense can carry a player a long way, however. the question that many scouts will grapple with when deciding on spot on their board is how much offensive upside does he possess. because as a first-year draft-eligible defenceman in the (something that portends exceedingly well for his nhl future), was nothing short of brilliant in the defensive zone — his reads were great; he always puts the puck in good places; he holds up physically under duress. if built on some of the offensive dynamism that he showed in two games at the hlinka-gretzky tournament last summer, there's no doubt he'd be closer to ten on my board. thing is — he didn't. without proof of concept beyond a two-game summer tournament, it's hard to imagine that's likely to change. i'm not sure that brynas if defenceman has the highest upside of any of the defencemen in this class behind byram, but he absolutely has the highest floor of any player in that position. , who only turned 18 in february, played top-four minutes virtually all season in the and held up quite well given the circumstances. there is just so much maturity to the way that plays the game. his puck retrievals are excellent, as always shoulder checks for a read on incoming pressure and surveys the ice for an outlet. he makes a superb first pass and can skate the puck out of his zone reasonably well, too. his battle level is through the roof. about that upside question, though. those concerns aren't unwarranted. didn't really flash a whole lot in the way of offensive skill this season, aside from some interesting moments at the hlinka-gretzky tournament last summer. i do wonder, though, how much of that is a result of the fact that was just trying to keep his head above water playing against men in — that would certainly be understandable. saw his stock climb as the season progressed and is now solidified in the top 20 prospects in the draft. is a two-way defender with excellent skating ability. he is a prototypical defender, and he excelled playing against men last season. projects as a two-way, 2nd pairing defender at the nhl level. he is likely 2-3 years away. considered a two-way defenseman, he keeps the game simple defensively, but he still stands out. while not an overly physical player, he makes his presence on the ice known in other ways and never gives up on pucks along the boards. he doesn't take many risks, so his passes are safe and usually calculated. while he isn't the fastest skater on the ice, he is still quick, mobile and smooth. good at clearing pucks in his own end, but from time to time he finds himself out of position as he is eager to track down his opponent. confident with the puck, he is a responsible player who plays with poise and patience. rarely makes mistakes with his high hockey iq. generally, makes good decisions but can sometimes try to do too much and put himself out of position as a result. offensively, he can jump into the play and join rushes, but should take more shots than he makes passes as he has a powerful shot. he's great at causing turnovers and has a knack for making great first passes. expected to be an offensive defenseman and has a very high upside. calm, confident and simple; all the makings of a responsible penalty killer. loads of potential and if anything, his biggest knock is that he sometimes tries to do too much.\n",

            "had a great first season, playing big minutes in all situations for there are a lot of positive attributes in his game. he has an absolute rocket from the point that can beat goalies clean, as well as generate opportunities around the net. he can move the puck very well with his brain and feet. his puck game is good, showing the ability to generate clean exists and entries, stretch the ice on breakouts, and showing confidence with the puck. he can at times make high-end plays with his poise and vison, but he also tends to be too cute with the puck and play without urgency, leading to costly turnovers. defensively i don't mind his game, but his strength is more with the puck than without it. i think his offensive game is high-end enough to balance out any minor defensive issues. he's going back to next season. one of the oldest first-year draft-eligible players in the draft, alongside lavoie, is an aggressive, heavy-shooting defenceman (note: heavy denotes the spin the shot creates, rather than velocity, making it tough for goalies to control the rebound) who can score in transition, offset plays to his one-timer, or through timely attacks to the slot or the backdoor play. defensively, plays a physical, glued-to-you-off-the-rush brand that can be really effective at holding the neutral zone and forcing turnovers but can also occasionally get him exposed. is a bit too much of a one-trick pony as a shooter offensively but he can still move the puck well enough and if that skill can be groomed there's significant room for growth in how he's used. is a good two-way defenseman who uses smarts over skill. his skating is good enough to get him up the ice and he's sturdy in his own zone, but there's not a lot in terms of overall puck skills or dynamicism. he is very decisive, making confident plays with the puck and allowing himself to get into space. there's not a lot of forcing it with him, and his offensive reads are pretty strong. on a weak rockets team, did a damn good job playing big minutes and contributing at both ends of the ice. he's an excellent puck-carrier, capable of leading a breakout with his feet or a strong first pass. he's opportunistic offensively, willing to drive the puck deep into the offensive zone to create chances. i like chances of developing into a strong two-way defenceman who can contribute to both phases of special teams. a fantastic skater with light feet and ease of movement, this finn is an exceptional skater at the elite level. his skating ability makes it hard to catch him or check him and he can use his speed to his advantage to create lanes up the ice. he is shifty and unpredictable, which makes it easier for him to skate the puck out of his own zone. his high-end mobility makes it so he can make crisp passes but sometimes those high-risk plays come at a cost. he is creative with the puck and has a great slap shot, which may not only stun the goalie but create rebounds for his teammates. it's play without the puck that concerns many, and it's safe to say his defensive play is a work in progress. as with many offensive defencemen, he takes some risks that he should avoid and at times when beaten, seems to lack the urgency needed to make it needs improvement when defending one-on-one, but has the ability to take the puck coast-to-coast if he does create a turnover. he plays with an edge and can be relied on to jump in the play offensively. as mentioned, needs to work on his defensive play, but has the tools to take his game to the next level if he puts the effort in.\n",

            "trended up quickly from a fine prospect to an almost lock to be drafted high this season. he was called up to his club team where he played a significant role, as well as on the u20 team. his hockey sense drives his value. is a calm, poised puck-moving defenseman who generates clean exits and entries with his vision, and makes plays on the man advantage. he's fine defensively due to his positional play, despite not being the biggest defender. however, he has limitations that may hinder him as he progresses. his size is obvious but his skating is also a minor concern. his stride breaks down when he gets going in a straight line, which is worrisome in a 5-foot-11 defender. i like his edges a lot, with showing a powerful burst on his first few steps to balance out the stride issue somewhat. growth this year has been incredible. it really has. every time i watched him play i came away more impressed than the last and that has made him one of the consistent risers on my list this season. and though he's a more complete player than honka, i don't see the same offensive level at his ceiling. is who is he because he's efficient (by that i mean that he makes plays quickly, he doesn't hesitate, but he does both of those things while still having surveyed the ice ahead of the decision), he quickly earns the trust of his coaches, he's precise in his execution offensively and he's compact and careful defensively. but he doesn't take over games and he's not going to be a dynamic offensive threat at the next level (though he showed signs that there may be more flair below the surface in the playoffs). he's really, really good. i just don't think he's going to be an outright star. he's probably going to be picked in the mid-to-late first round, that's fine. having spent the entire season playing quality minutes in top pro league, is especially intriguing. i think his skating is only average for a player his size, which keeps him from ranking a bit higher. there are more sub-6-foot defensemen in the nhl, but you still need to be able to skate at a high level. however, he makes up for it in his hockey sense. coaches won't have to worry about him too much because he's so poised and moves the puck with incredible efficiency, even though his offensive skills are not necessarily dynamic. he defends decently well, closing on opposing forwards quickly. the fact that minutes only went up in the playoffs shows how highly valued he is at such a young age. on paper, profiles like a top-five pick. the defenceman spent his entire season in the playing against men, and produced at a clip better than that of former third-overall pick and dallas stars defenceman miro heiskanen — though not as prolific as anttoni honka, who we'll get to in a minute. only has one historical comparable player, and based on their inputs, pgps projects to score at a 46-point clip on a per season basis in the nhl. the difficulty i'm having — and it's quite common — is reconciling production with how the player looks on film. usually, someone who is this productive offensively as a first-time draft-eligible player in a men's league would possess high-end skating or a heavy shot — something that jumps off of the screen. that's not really the case with , though he's above average in most regards. on paper, profiles like a prolific, offensive dynamo of a defenceman. his scoring rate as a first-time draft-eligible player in the men's league is higher than that of fellow countrymen and rookie defensive phenom miro heiskanen — that good. i'm not sure any part of game suggests that offence at this rate is what we should project for him at the nhl level though. his shot is okay, nothing special, and i don't see a player that's an active contributor in the offensive zone. i like hockey sense, and it's easy to imagine a scenario where he develops into a second-pair defenceman. it will take some refinement on the part of the team that drafts him, but the possibility exists. has been cranking out strong prospects today, and is no exception. biggest asset is his hockey sense and his ability to make a strong first pass. has very few flaws in his game. he does need to get stronger, but that will come with time. he projects as a top 4 defender with offensive upside. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl ready. a capable puck-moving defenseman, is poised under pressure and makes small but smart plays in his own end. overall, his skating is good, even though he could stand to add a bit more speed. he's agile, has quick first-step acceleration and can shake off opponents with quick turns. he defends aggressively in the neutral zone, which can result in odd-man rushes for his team. he creates turnovers and is good at forcing the opposing team to try to cross the neutral zone again. his biggest weaknesses are on the defensive side of things. he gets caught out of position multiple times at even-strength and on the penalty kill. the fact that he gets outmuscled pretty easily doesn't necessarily help the situation. he's trusted to play on the penalty kill despite his mistakes, which tells you something about his coaching staff's faith in him. he carries the puck with confidence and is excellent at traversing his way through the neutral zone. he's shown an ability to play a deceptive offensive game. he's able to make quick, small plays when required, but also has poise with the puck. his passes are mostly accurate and crisp. his game needs refining and he doesn't necessarily have any standout tools, but he projects to be solid two-way defenseman with an offensive upside.\n",

            ", the 2017 second-overall pick in the draft, was a good junior player the past two years and got better as the season went along and in the postseason. he's a smart and competitive winger. he's very intelligent, flashing high-end vision and tending to make good decisions with the puck. as the season went along he showed more consistent playmaking and overall dynamic elements. he's got some soft skill, but he's more of a distributor than an individual creator. he's got very good hands in tight and scored several nifty goals. his shot is also good, and he can score with his wrist shot in tight. works hard, is strong on pucks, and wins his fair share of battles along the boards and in front of the net. he's already quite strong, measuring in at over 200 pounds. his skating is ok. some days he flashes a good top gear and other times i don't think his pace is anything noteworthy. , taken second-overall in the 2017 draft, has progressed well ever since without really taking huge leaps. given the talent level that was already there, though, that has produced a darn good player. he's a lot to handle along the wall, is willing to go to the net with that power by dropping his shoulder and using one hand on his stick to force his way to the crease (or the slot) and has what has always been some sneaky-good passing skills that can surprise defenders who expect him to drive the net for a scoring chance, only to find the trailer. that versatility will translate well to the pro game. he also tracks the play back to stay above pucks and in responsible positions within sherbrooke's structure, making him a positive presence in all three zones. was the best player on an otherwise mediocre team and played his best hockey late in the season (he finished the year on a seven-game point streak) and into the playoffs, where he posted eight goals and 14 points in 10 games. a good summer should make him one of the tougher players to contain next season. has been one of the toughest players for me to rank. there are times when you see a player showing what he can do with his size and skill. there are other times when he disappears. the effort needs to be better. aside from that, the skill he has in that sturdy frame of his is tantalizing. if he finds a level of consistency to force his will more during games, he has a chance to outperform his draft ranking in a major way. you just get the sense watching that he's going to will himself to the nhl. his skill level is high-end, and possesses a great deal of creativity with the puck, sure, but his work ethic is off of the charts good. if there's a loose puck on the offensive zone; he's the first one there. if the defenceman is trying to execute a breakout; is going to make it as difficult as is humanly possible. that skill, and work ethic project well at the next level for . so, too, does his skating. is an explosive skater with a strong first two strides and good top-end speed. as he gets more physically mature those traits are only going to improve. there wasn't a lot of talent around in sherbrooke, and all he did was produce at an elite level in the he's a creative offensive player with high-end offensive upside. he can put the puck in the back of the net and distribute it to his teammates with about the same amount of skill. the major concern with game is that he's not the fleetest of foot. other than that, there aren't many holes in his game. it's easy to imagine a scenario where develops into an impactful middle-six player at the nhl. is a strong, power forward type player who has seen his stock climb this season. skating has improved as the season has progressed, and he has shown an ability to put up points and produce offensively. uses his size and strength to his advantage. he projects as a low-end 2nd-line winger. he is likely 2-3 years away from nhl duty. a decent skater with an above-average top gear, has long strides but he has trouble accelerating in tight spaces. however, he can beat defenders wide once he's given open ice and has the speed to be considered a threat coming across the offensive blue line. his stops, first steps and turns in control of the puck are very aesthetic and quick. knowing he's got speed and strength, he loves to dump the puck deep to recover it. he is very good at handling the puck with speed and is a complete power forward. he has a great control of the puck with one hand, which allows him to protect his puck very effectively. he's aggressive offensively and can lead the rush by carrying the puck into the offensive zone and set up possession. never one to shy away from board battles, he will go to the corners and usually comes out with the puck. he is responsible defensively and puts in the necessary effort to stop plays down low. he's patient in his own zone and watches the play so he can be at the position, at the time to create turnovers. also very active once his team regains possession of the puck, he makes himself an immediate option to complete the zone exit. his work ethic is elite and he's a tenacious, hardworking forward who doesn't take a shift off.\n",

            "had a great season, as a go-to player for when its lineup was depleted, and he continued to produce and generate shots at a high level when the roster filled out, although he tailed off toward the end. he doesn't wow you with his tools, but he's a quality player. is a very smart all-around hockey player. he sees the ice very well, is creative with the puck and understands the game away from the puck. he's not the biggest guy but competes well. he gets to the net and gets back on defense. with the puck, he's skilled but not amazingly so. he can make some space with his hands, and his shot can surprise goalies with the ability to pick corners. his skating leaves some to be desired. he has decent speed but not great for his size, and his stride is inefficient. i give a nod to his sense and production as indicators that he could play in the nhl. playoff performance was disappointing by most measures. his play on the team's third line at even-strength didn't have enough of an impact to tilt games way when they needed him. throughout, he was also used on the in spurts instead of at centre, which is a little odd given he was 55 percent on nearly 600 faceoffs in the regular season. is a player who does a lot of different things really well at the junior level but (outside of maybe his release) doesn't have any standout skill that really leaves you thinking “that will translate to the nhl.” as a result, he projects as a third-line forward more than a high-end scorer, even though his 36 goals ranked third among under-18 forwards this season to kaliyev and 2020 prospect cole perfetti. he needs to get stronger if his is going to take off. one of the fastest players in the draft, carved out a substantial role for himself on a talented team and was one of the top draft-eligible producers in the this season. his shot really improved this season with a good, quick release. he competes, too, playing with tenacity, and his ability to create on the rush is among his more important attributes. as he gets stronger, he's going to be difficult to handle down low. death, taxes, and the knights producing among the best two-way pivots at the draft like clockwork. next in line for the seemingly endless succession of defense-first centres from the legendary franchise is , who was a consistent riser from puck-drop onward. many believe that has upside beyond what he's shown thus far at the level, and i tend to agree with that assessment. has excellent vision as a puck-carrier and always seems to find his linemates and get them the puck in position to score. he's not afraid to shoot the puck either as his estimated ten-plus shots per hour at 5-on-5 can attest. is a well-rounded that plays for the nhl factory knights in the game isn't flashy, but it is consistent. he always finds a way to put up points and make his team better. has above-average hockey sense and is an excellent skater. he will likely have a big jump in offensive production next season. he is likely 2-3 years away. very skilled two-way forward with speed and vision who possess a fluid stride and can gain a high-end top speed in a hurry with the puck on his stick, carrying it through the neutral zone. does an exceptional job of breaking up passes and plays in the neutral zone thanks to his positioning and active stick work. transitions quickly from defense to offense with ease, often faster than his opponents can react and can beat defenders in tight while protecting the puck for dangerous scoring opportunities in close. seems to process the game exceptionally well compared to his peers and consistently shows that he can turn the most simple of plays into quality scoring opportunities. anticipates the play well and always seems to know where to be on the ice. possesses a solid shot, and the smarts to be an excellent playmaker and has the ability to create dangerous scoring opportunities. on the backcheck, he uses good positioning and a quick stick to break up plays and generally clog up the neutral zone. he's very aggressive in his own end and unforgiving in his effort to pressure the puck carrier to make a mistake. isn't afraid to use his solid size to separate the puck carrier and the puck, but only when necessary. constantly smart when it comes to the 200-foot game and makes good choices with or without the puck.\n",

            "played his first full season in the after playing midget aaa as a 16-year-old. he was one of the best rookies in the league, working his way into a major offensive role on moose jaw's top line and eventually top power play at the u18s. is the kind of player who you want with the puck. he's a creative offensive player with high-end, offensive hockey sense. he's always looking to make a play, controls the puck well and sees his options very well. sometimes he tries to do too much and can force pucks where the option isn't available, but i like that he tries things. he's got a lean body and can struggle versus bigger players, but he goes to the net, scoring a lot of goals this season around the tough areas. skating for me is so-so with a stride that lacks power and breaks down. he has enough speed to skate with pros but not challenge them. some scouts like it and think, when his lanky frame fills out, he'll be fine; but for me, he lacks that extra gear. the rookie of the year and one of the fastest risers in this draft class, has really good puck skills and vision, with an ability to make plays under pressure. his skating is probably closer to average, but i don't view it as a hindrance. he gets to the hard areas well enough and can make some decent plays on the rush. continuously elevating his game, may not be an elite skater but he is quick on his edges. he has the ability to improve his speed and footwork as he possesses the raw talent to improve. while his skating needs work, he does possess the ability to make quick turns and transitions. he has a quick shot and seems to recognize when passing lanes open and he appears to play with patience when he has the puck. with that said, he sometimes tries to get too creative which often results in him losing the puck on his stick when under duress. while he plays with poise and patience, he could use more urgency in his game when it's necessary. without the puck, could use improvement and needs to learn to better use his body on the backcheck. sometimes making the wrong body check at the wrong time, needs to learn to read the defensive play better. what he lacks in physicality, he makes up in making quick decisions and can be an opportunistic playmaker. overall, he is a raw talent with room for improvement, but he definitely has a high ceiling if he can realize his potential. relied on for power-play minutes, he is someone who can take responsibility in all three zones of the ice once his game is better rounded.\n",

            "was a name touted in the prospect world for a few years. he didn't put up amazing boxcar numbers, but he was a solid two-way defenseman for sioux falls who tilted the ice when he was on and was a rock at the world jr. a challenge for team what immediately stands out is his skating. he's an effortless skater who can evade checks and generate clean zone exits with his feet. he's not a blazing fast skater, but his edges and first step are high end. has a good skill level but that part of his game didn't stand out as much as his feet. some scouts think his puck game is great, but i've seen him just good in that regard. he sees the ice very well, and while he can make a big play, he also has a tendency to turn too many pucks over and at times be careless with his decisions. i don't see him as a true point producer in the nhl. defensively he's not the biggest guy, but he's so solid due to his smarts and mobility. his gap control is very good and often closes on guys quicker than they anticipate. truth be told, he's a player i've never been blown away by, but he's a player who every scout and source i know pushed very hard, so this ranking may undervalue him a bit. is one of the best skating defensemen in this entire class. he's an exceptional defender who performed at his best in big games this season. but he is a pretty raw talent when it comes to ability to make plays in the offensive zone, which is why he's a little further down the board. in faster-paced games, he focuses a lot more on defending, and i don't know that he has the offensive sense to make effective plays up ice. still, the feet and defensive sense are so strong that he might be the most intriguing second-round-graded player on my board, and i wouldn't pick on a team that grabs him earlier. underestimate at your own peril. the point totals don't scream first round, but it's clear as day upon watching that it's precisely where he belongs. even if offensive upside is limited (which is up for debate), the modern nhl is replete with defensive defencemen that carved out lengthy, successful careers by tilting the ice whenever they stepped onto the ice. that's the type of player projects to be at the next level. what i appreciate about defensive game is that it's predicated on preventing clean zone entries, good puck retrievals and his team possessing the puck. the opposition is entering the offensive zone with control of the puck on just 30 percent of their attempts when they target , and his team is controlling more than 56 percent of the shot attempts when he's on the ice. a play like this one is a perfect example of why that's the case. denies the an entry, and before they've recovered the puck is on his teammate's stick, and they're on the attack. one of the scouts i spoke to about suggested that upside remains a concern with , and it's worth noting. perhaps tops out as a fourth defenceman. even so, if you can find that player late in the first round, you take it. i also think that offensive capabilities will show themselves as he plays with better players around him in the where he's committed to the university of next season. while the role of the defensive defenceman is getting smaller with each passing year, there are still a few elite, defensively sound blueliners in the nhl that find a way to contribute without offering an awful lot on the traditional score sheet. sioux falls stampede defenceman has the potential to be one of those players. is a great skater, who can generate speed with ease and is nimble on his edges. he's an elusive puck-carrier, capable of executing a breakout from the defensive zone with ease. despite playing huge minutes for the stampede, against top competition, escaped the sample of games i tracked with a 61 percent share of shot attempts and a 60 percent ratio of scoring chance control. a smooth skater with high-end skills, plays a simple game and is calm when he has the puck in and among pressure. due to his skating ability, he's a great option to carry the puck up the ice. his positioning is good, his transition game is above average and he plays strong on his skates. showing awesome aggressiveness in front of his own net, he ties up bodies and the sticks of opponents well. he plays with an active stick in the defensive zone and defends the blue line well by standing up opponents. due to his strong positioning, he often forces opponents to dump in the puck instead of letting them have a controlled zone entry. he always seems to make the play out of his own zone and shows a great ability to find the smart pass on outlets due to his high hockey iq. relentless along the board in battles, he shows good instincts and awareness at both end of the ice and in the neutral zone. he jumps in on the rush when he sees an opportunity to do so. he's calm, cool and collected in deep and tough down low on the power play. he has a good shot and doesn't need much room to fire it on net. he's also able to let his wrist shot go even with defenders draped on top of him.\n",

            "is one of the most interesting players for me in this draft class. i watched him about as much as any prospect, going though about half his games this season. every game i saw of him, there were 1 or 2 instances that you marveled. he shows you glimpses of elite talent and someone who can be an impact winger. pure puck skill is up there with the very best in the draft class. he dances with the puck on his stick and can make flashy dekes seem routine. his hands also translate to making him one of the best pick pockets (of pucks) i've seen at his age. he's a good playmaker who looks to makes plays to his teammates and has the patience and skill to hold the puck and let an option develop. he can finish chances, too, and when he's played internationally, the german team has looked to him as a trigger man. his skating is fine, not explosive, but average. the main criticism of him is off the puck. he's not a very intense physical player nor is he great defensively. his production hasn't been amazing this season in junior circuit, but he didn't play much high-level hockey until 17, so his game needs some maturing. i rank him this high despite low production because of his immense talent, no character flags, and i could see his spiking as he continues to play high-level hockey. is a big kid with room still to grow. he is so deceptive that he plays like he's smaller than he is. he's extremely poised with the puck and one of the better skaters in the class, which made him an offensive forced in superelit. still, while he's an explosive threat, the rest of his game lacks: he nearly never engages physically without the puck and tends to reach with his stick instead; he coasts back in transition; he doesn't fully pursue loose pucks; and he's easily frustrated with his teammates. if he can sort those things out, he's got second-line nhl upside. we'll see. there's no question he's a first-round talent. i've been up and down on this season, as i believe he definitely has high-end puck skills. there's a lot of dynamism to his game, which you don't often find in german players. he had a strong season in u20 ranks and even got some reps with champion vaxjo in the this season. he got pretty significant playing time when he was up, though he only ended up with a goal and an assist. that's all great experience for the 17-year-old regardless of how he produced. his passing ability is up there with some of the best players in this draft. he can make defenders miss, and his poise with the puck is pretty solid. he has a good shot, too, but i think he's more of a pass-first guy, and it suits him. what i'm curious about is how will do in the tougher games. he had a lot of time and space this year in the u20 ranks and thrived. the pro game showed that he still has a ways to go in terms of making plays under pressure and being behind some of his peers physically. of the players i have in this range on my board, probably has the highest upside, which is why i would not be surprised to see him go higher than i have him. agile, quick hands, elusive in the offensive zone and makes a habit of landing on the scoresheet. big-time j20 season and received a cup of coffee in the he's just getting started after transitioning from the german league where the quality of competition wasn't high enough. if you like high-octane skill, you'll love . a highly talented winger with one on one ability, quick hands, and creative passing. can challenge goalies with his shot, too with his skillset, he is a threat every time he suits up. his skating, according to one scout, is world class. above-average acceleration with his quick first steps. and with the puck, he exhibits tremendous poise. his stickhandling is tremendous, as is his vision with the puck. he is a natural passer. even under pressure, he thread passes to teammates. his shot is strong. in fact, he could stand to use it more instead of first looking to make a passing play to a teammate. working one-onone, he's got the tools to be successful, even at top speed. if his high-tempo pace and snappy passes prove to be too much for teammates, he's been known to slam his stick on the ice in frustration, then coast slowly back to the bench. his body language can be poor. if he demands the puck and doesn't get it, he's been seen cussing out guilty linemates on the ice. physically, he can be nonchalant, preferring to try to poke-check the puck instead of stepping into his man. his work rate in his own end and without the puck is not good. defensively, there are flaws in game. sometimes, he doesn't go the extra mile to win races into the defensive zone. he's brushed up his work ethic, but, at times, he can appear lazy in his responsibilities. a standout, but only when he wants to be. definitely, a high-risk/high-reward type of prospect.\n",

that's the million dollar question with . there are moments where you watch him and think the answer is maybe, but more likely he'll just be an above-average skill guy. while his shot/finishing ability is a bit worrying, has the speed, skills, smarts and physicality to be a very good playmaker and zone entry artist as an nhler combined with being a reliable two-way that has a lot of value. is one of the best skaters in the class, not only at his top speed, but, more importantly, in the way he accelerates and changes pace with the puck — which allows him to control and dictate tempo. he backs defenders off, stops up and finds the trailer in the slot as well as anyone in this draft. i'd still like to see him shoot more and be more aggressive in attacking the low slot with possession when he has the step on a defenceman, but he doesn't have a heavy shot. he's a pass-first centre who is extremely committed to the defensive zone, uses his feet to be the first man back, wins races for loose pucks, and works hard to play within his team's systems. i don't think he has first line upside, but he can be the passer on my team's top pp unit and a contributing, detail freak, checking centre who can play up and down the lineup on my team any day. the best way to describe is probably \"well-rounded.\" he's not truly elite at any one thing, but he's effective in all zones, strong on the puck and committed to playing strong defensively. offensive skills are also strong, highlighted primarily by quick hands and some shiftiness. he also protects the puck with a strong frame and powerful skating. for as skilled as is, he has a strong defensive work ethic. i think one of the biggest questions surrounding is his year-to-year progression after being granted exceptional status to enter the a year early. he hasn't taken remarkably big steps forward as a player, which makes me wonder about his overall upside. that said, the level he's playing at now as a and the versatility he brings to the table are why i still have him a bit higher. the last four players to be granted that exceptional status were john tavares, aaron ekblad, mcdavid and sean day, and three of them went no. 1 overall in the nhl draft. a jack-of-all-trades player with a nice tool belt. great edgework, acceleration, vision and puck-protection skills. blazing fast in a straight line. the 18-year-old is already a consummate worker in the defensive end and is a very safe selection as he has a pro-level approach. one of the best power play distributors in the there is so much to like about . he's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better. the fleet-footed is unselfish and will primarily look to make a play at top speed; however, when the chance arises to put it in the pot himself, he will capitalize. he sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. his defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. all-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor. if he can find the consistency in refusing to let himself get taken out of plays, especially if he doesn't start them, he will thrive and exceed expectations. a terrific centerman, he is a great skater, with high-end top speed and extremely good mobility. he skates low with a wide stance, just like sidney crosby. his first steps and acceleration are breathtaking – not to mention one of his top assets. he can change pace, he can change directions, and he owns tremendous puckhandling skills. he's able to hold onto the puck at top speed with his head up. he protects the puck very well with his body and he can get into shooting position using his strong legs. he is incredibly smart, with and without the puck, and he knows how to feed his teammates. flashy, with an impressive shot. in tight space, he is an elite presence. working in one-on-one battles, his quick hands allow him to take hold of the puck more often than not. lots of speed, lots of skill, to go with a very high compete level. he's visible on every shift and involved in everything on the ice. even defensively, his work rate stands out. he forechecks and backchecks very hard. with a big hit or using his quick hands, he can often steal the puck. he never misses an opportunity to throw a bodycheck, although sometimes he crosses the line with hits from behind and boarding. is even good on the penalty kill. blocks shots, too. opportunities to grow as a leader for this ‘exceptional' standout.\n",

            "everything has been pointing in the direction for this season. he was fantastic from the word \"go,\" between league and international play, and has put himself into the discussion to go first overall. he's the complete package offensively. he's a very good skater, with the ability to be dangerous due to his first step and top gear but particularly due to how elusive he is from a standstill. is a creative puck handler who can dictate possession with his skill and often stands out with how he can generate offense with his creativity. however, his best trait is his hockey sense. he anticipates pressure so well, moves the puck into the places and outsmarts defenders. \"[] can take over a game and does so consistently,\" one scout said. he's not a bulky guy, but he gets to the net with frequency and is a solid defensive he can potentially be a very good top-six player for his nhl team. top end speed, vision and processing skills. he's incredibly gifted at finding quiet spaces and exposing defenders whose gap control is even just marginally off. his soft hands and deft puck protection allow him to work his magic down low while his quick release is deadly from the circles down. the best offensive player in this crop is a very smooth skater that can turn on a dime and keep his speed while doing so. he is very agile and is hard to contain along the board. is very well balanced on his feet and can make sharp 180 degree spins to escape opponents during battles along the board. you think he'll be pinned and won't be able to escape, and then he surprises you by making a move and quickly dangling his way off the wall and into a scoring opportunity. his speed is above average but he rarely seems to go full speed, instead using his quickness, agility and creativity to elude. he draws penalties due to his elusiveness. great anticipation and hockey sense allow him to retrieve a puck even after it leaves his blade - the puck appears glued to his stick as he possesses magic hands in tight. he possesses top end hands which he uses to beat defenders and goaltenders with high-end skill plays. he is not a one-trick pony as he can skillfully deke out defenseman via 1-on-1 rushes or keep his opponent off guard by giving the puck quickly to another teammate, finding open space and getting the puck back when he has more time to create or culitvate a scoring opportunity. he is equally skilled with dexterity and smoothness on his backhand as he is on his forehand. his passes are consistently on tape, delivered through the tightest of lanes and he displays great hand eye coordination as he is able to control bouncing pucks. his shot is not the most powerful but it is very accurate and deceptive, with quick releases while off balance. the offensive game looks too easy for him in many instances. defensively, he is usually in good position to support his teammates, anticipating the play well and generating quick breakouts. he is primarily an offensive catalyst so there is some definite defensive work to be done in his game. he is not very physical, and is easily pushed off the puck and eliminated in traffic due to his lack of strength. on a couple of occasions this season he was, more or less, shut down when opponents played him rough and tough. as this happened in the quebec junior league, he will need to work hard to prove he can battle through being handled by bigger opponents at the nhl level. another concern we have is his tendency to take his foot off the pedal during games.\n",

            "didn't have the best draft season he could have envisioned, mostly because he missed a substantial part of the season due to injury. however, he remains a top prospect. best trait is his hockey sense. he's a highly creative playmaker, with high-end vision and puck skills. he can dictate the tempo of a game, with pro-level pace in his decisions and the ability to slow the play and find his options. also shows an above-average shot and can generate it from tight spaces. his skating isn't as dynamic as his playmaking, as it's more about pro average than top level, but he'll be able to keep up in the nhl. he's a player without a glaring flaw, as he'll be what you want in a top-level center: a two-way forward with skill, size and intelligence who can contribute in all areas of the game. is a franchise-level, big, strong, and smart top-line with a complete game who should pay quick dividends. often injured in recent years, whoever drafts him will do their due diligence and cross fingers hoping past injuries don't impact future performance. is a top-line that plays both ends of the ice. he processes the game so quickly that there is rarely hesitation in his play. he is always moving his feet and gains momentum because of his ability to accelerate quickly; starting and stopping on the puck. his stride length is excellent and he shows great hustle. he has the ability to quickly change direction and move laterally to cut off and get ahead of opponents. his skillset is so wellrounded and he is so hungry to achieve success that it can be difficult for an opponent to defend him at this level. his passing game is solid, hitting teammates for clean passes with just the amount of mustard. he is an unselfish player who draws so much attention to himself that it allows more space for his teammates to get to open spots. he shoots the puck without hesitation, and is able to unload quickly with both velocity and accuracy. he has good timing on his shots and can really queue up a dangerous one-timer. he can overwhelm his opponents by being heavy on the puck and showing off effective puckhandling and puck protection skills. he isn't all flash and dash but a lot of the highly-skilled plays he makes go without much credit. his quickness and skill make him one of the most disruptive players on the ice - he is capable of magically stealing pucks and making a play before opponents know the puck is off their blade. his reach, hand eye coordination and positioning, including his ability to break up plays defensively, make no puck in his general vicinity safe. he shows high iq with his decision-making skills on and off the puck. he is hard on the body and plays with healthy aggression. he has a physical edge to him and can rock opponents with a timely hit. will stand up for himself when challenged, fighting and feeding some solid punches to opponents who think they can intimidate him. he competes hard; displayed by his willingness to engage on second and third efforts to disrupt plays, trying to make an impact all over the ice. we all know he can play and has the prerequisite skills to contribute at the next level but for a guy who had difficulty staying out of sick bay since suffering a sports hernia during the 2015-16 playoffs, there are some injury concerns that will need to be alleviated by medical professionals. there have also been some rumblings about an all-aboutme type of attitude creeping in this season and perceived lackadaisical play in some games, but in our opinion those concerns are overblown.\n",

            "was a significant riser this season, after producing at a point-per-game pace versus men in and often appearing on highlight reels for positive reasons. has very quick hands and a ton of creativity in his game, and even when he's being tightly checked, he's able to generate space for himself. he sees the ice very well and can make difficult feeds. \"he has the talent to be a star,\" one scout said. that doesn't mean game is perfect. he has heavy feet and struggles to win battles as he has a wiry frame and isn't a very intense battler. on the other hand, it's hard to ignore his significant point-producing potential as a pro and his ability to be a game-breaker on the ice. in my viewings, i didn't see him ever have a great game. however, every scout i've talked to was willing to go to bat for him as a top-end prospect. the slight forward thinks the game a step ahead of most players his age. his top-end speed leaves something to be desired but his creativity and strong positional play make him a coach's dream. he needs at least 20 lbs of muscle packed on before handling an nhl schedule. is a positionally-sound pivot with edgeof-your-seat highlight reel worthy puck skills. he has natural offensive creativity and shows good patience with the puck. his skating is above-average with an impressive “jersey flapping” top gear. speed isn't his only standout attribute, he also displays great hockey sense and awareness, always aware of where his teammates are, allowing him to distribute quick, accurate passes, including no-look and drop passes. in addition, he has quick, skilled hands and excellent one-on-one moves that allow him to finesse his way past defensive players or deke out goaltenders with a quick move. he is very poised with the puck in the offensive zone, displaying good patience and good vision to find open passing lanes while being pressured. he has a dangerous shot with a deceiving release that has been known to give goaltenders fits. he is very confident with the puck, displays good patience and good vision to find open passing lanes while being pressured. he doesn't initiate contact often, but isn't afraid of going to the corners to retrieve the puck. he works hard on the defensive end and seems to understand the defensive responsibilities of the position, and how to best interact with defensemen to work as a unit. he can be rotated to the at times, showing versatility, but still does a good job supporting the puck low in his own zone and is quick and decisive once he gets control. he is good at getting in on the forecheck, creating a lot of pressure and establishing a cycle game together with his linemates. his biggest standout attribute is certainly his speed, as defensemen have great troubles keeping up with him when he rushes through the neutral zone. however, despite having an impressive top gear, he needs to work on his leg strength as his explosiveness and first few steps are rather lacking at this stage. his core strength is also an area that needs to be addressed as he can be easily rubbed off the puck along the boards. he needs to bulk up to be more successful using his pure speed, and needs to improve his puck protection ability. the strength deficit also hurts defensive play, as he finds it difficult to use his body to defend or take his man off the puck. instead, he tends to just use his stick every time, with limited success.\n",

' puck skills are very good, with the iq and skill combo to create scoring chances out of nothing. he's very coordinated with the puck for a player his size, and he makes tough dekes seem easy. he's a smart playmaker who can make plays at a quick tempo and control the third of the ice. some scouts i talk to praise his skating. i haven't seen a blow-you-away gear from him, but he's certainly above average in that area. defensively, he is decent. his frame needs to bulk up a ton, as he can be pushed off pucks too easily, but he works hard for pucks and has the iq to be useful in his own end. a terrific season has shot him up the rankings and for good reason. he's the best pure playmaker in the draft, owns a sizable frame and an underrated shot. he's in line for a monster draft-plus one campaign and has the potential to become the best centre from the bunch. is a tall, lanky pivot who plays a gritty, skilled, thinking man's game. he is a two-way guy, making a ton of impact plays at both ends of the ice. he can play a north-south game but also possesses some shiftiness and finesse to his approach. he sees the ice extremely well and his passing game, while lacking high-end creativity, is effective at threading the needle through tight areas while in motion. he has silky hands in tight and is a danger to do damage around the crease or to jam in a backdoor play. has a good wrist shot and backhander with the type of accuracy that allows him to finish off plays. he is patient, looks for and finds open lanes to the net and gets his shots off with quickness on the release. he utilizes an active stick in the defensive zone to get to loose pucks, close off lanes or to deflect pucks. he has a bit of a rugged side to him, although he isn't a true hard-nosed player. he uses a smart approach to checking and doesn't always have to be a brute to slip in, separate the puck from the body and make a heads up play out of the zone. shows great compete to get quick on pucks and make decisive plays. he is able to muscle through checks and shift his angles to protect the puck with a man on him. always seemed to be in a great position to support the play. he is smart and times puck arrivals so he had the element of surprise on his side. he is proficient at seeing plays develop; angling bodies to the boards and stepping up to make himself available for passes before clearing the zone. he shows a bit of an edge, but doesn't show the aggression to instigate a lot of rough stuff. his play can look understated in many games but then you check and he has his name all over the scoresheet. isn't a top tier skater as he looks and moves a little awkward. we wouldn't call him slow as he gets up to speed quickly, but he is not a burner and his stride is choppy. his skating will be able to be corrected and improved as he works on his technique with a skating coach. the ability to add strength and mass will help his game develop further as he is currently a slender kid. although this is fine at the current level he will need to add strength to compete at the nhl level. he is not projected to be a real top end offensive contributor at the nhl level.\n",

            "the cousin of the no. 33 overall pick in 2015, mitchell stephens (tampa bay lightning), is a very exciting winger to watch. he was a dominant goal scorer this season, due to both the quality and quantity of shots on goal. is one of the best speedsters in the draft class. his ability to go from 0 to 60 -- metaphorically speaking, though he's darn quick -- is very impressive, and he can gain the offensive blue line with ease. he has a high skill level and can make some open-ice plays, but he's much more comfortable going north-south than east-west. he can kill penalties due to his speed and iq, and can be a shorthanded scoring threat while doing so. game is more about playing in straight lines, but don't let his very tilted goal-to-assist ratio fool you, as he can make plays to his teammates too, a facet of his game that improved as the season went on. concerns over hockey sense and ability to play without the puck are reasonably legit, but he owns the best shot in the draft and as such the goal scoring potential is through the roof. needs to score more goals within five feet of the net though. is a natural goal-scorer with the speed and size combo that has nhl teams very excited. he is a great skater, powerful and balanced, generating high levels of speed. he has a finisher's touch and goal-scorer's mentality, getting himself premier looks at the net. he has a lethal shot, with an all-world release and impressive strength behind it that rivals many nhl goal-scorers. he gets into dangerous areas without the puck, looking for a pass and getting his shot off quickly. his willingness to release his shot early and often leads to some juicy rebounds in front of the net and some sustained possessions in the offensive end for his team. he is strong on the puck, driving down the with power and speed, putting himself into strong shooting positions, unafraid to take the puck to the net by driving through traffic. known for his lethal, nhl level shot, also proves to be an excellent passer with solid vision who can accurately get the puck where it needs to be. not only does create passing lanes all over the ice through his speedy skating, he has an incredible ability to protect the puck using body positioning and strength when pressured without a solid outlet. plays in all situations but really excels at 5 on 5 and the power play. he's an absolute terror for pk units as he quarter backs the pp from the high circle and blue line, tossing sharp passes all over the zone, dangling his way out of tight spots and unleashing his laser beam shot. looks to be at his best on the rush when he can couple his speed and shot together. defensively, his speed is especially dangerous on the forecheck where his quick feet can put pressure on defenders, causing turnovers. the weakest part of game is on the defensive side of the puck where he doesn't compete hard enough to regain possession of the puck. as an example, during races for loose pucks, will often slam on the breaks to avoid body contact - essentially handing the opposing player puck possession and forcing him to chase. he will need to improve his puck retrieval skills and compete level when he does not have the puck. speed is rarely seen defensively and he is often seen coasting on the back check. contrast that with the speed demon that he is when he has the puck and you can see there is much less urgency to his defensive play. he also tends to make some head-scratching, dead ending, plays that leave you questioning his hockey sense. one lesser flaw that we have noticed is he consistently overplays the puck and attempts overly complex plays.\n",

            "one of the best defensemen in the this season, also recorded the highest point totals ever by an under-18 defenseman at the wjc. is a fantastic skater. he exerts very little effort to get up to a dangerous top gear and moves well in all directions. his puck movement is high-end, as he shows calmness, skill and elite hockey sense when he has the puck on his stick. he's able to qb a power play with the best of them, on top of creating dangerous chances in transition. he's also not afraid to take risks, but he's very calculating when he does, and rarely does he hurt his team. smarts translate to defense. he is always getting his stick on pucks and is an overall reliable defensive player in his positional play. he could stand to bulk up quite a bit, as he has a bit of a beanpole frame (6-foot-2, 182 pounds). however, still works hard on the ice to win battles and get to pucks even if his frame isn't ideal for those situations yet. is a fuid, two-way defenseman who plays a strong puck-moving game. he processes the game at a very high level and appears very calm when pressured, not rushing just any old play with the puck, but instead evaluating what would be the best play. he quickly escapes trouble with his quick feet and good puck protection before moving the puck to the safe option. his choices of pass options are very strong and put him a good position to help his team succeed. he is a strong backward skater who can vary his speed based on the play in front of him thanks to his ability to anticipate and react quickly. keeps strong gaps and an active stick to knock pucks off his opponents' sticks. a very mature thinker, he just always seems to be aware of what is going on around him and seems able to predict what is going to happen next. reacts well to add support on the wall in an effort to get the puck free; once he gets it on his tape, he does a good job of pushing the play forward by either skating it or with a crisp pass to his target in open ice. when he sees the opportunity, he will come off the blueline and skate into the puck to unload a slap shot as well, and while his shot is not overly powerful, he gets it on target and places it where he wants it. he consistently dishes crisp passes to his best options, seeing the ice very well in front of him and to the side, executing strong d-to-d passes and being there as a support option for his partner when he does not have the puck. carries the puck on the attack with poise and speed, showing no signs of hesitation or losing control of the puck, even at his top speed. he displays incredible awareness as he works his way up ice, reading the play and seeing lanes develop very well. he shows off some quick hands and feet as he moves the puck at the point, holding onto it until a lane presents itself to slip a pass through. has good offensive instincts to read the play and drop down from the point to support his teammates in possession. can be prone to chasing the puck carrier and extending his stick instead of playing the body. this leaves him open to being manipulated by faster or more skilled puckhandlers and looking silly when he gets beat by a dangle or two. defensively, he makes head-scratching decisions. also needs to avoid coming to a stop when defending as this limits his effectiveness and gives the man the space needed to make a play. there's not much in the way of physical play to this guy as he does not play with much grit or sandpaper. his shot is accurate and effective in getting to the net for his skilled teammates in to manufacture a second chance, but it has low velocity and will need to improve to remain effective at the next level.\n",

            "is one of the very best freshmen of the modern era, and had a simply fantastic season. his skill level is elite, and it's off the charts for a 6-2 forward in terms of the amount of high-level plays he makes regularly. uses a longer than average stick, and with his wingspan and skills he can be almost impossible to get off of the puck. he makes evasions seem effortless to where i often hear from scouts that he looks \"bored\" on the ice because he exerts so little energy when he makes defensemen miss. he's strong, works hard and thinks the game at such a high level that he creates chances in bunches. his hockey sense allows him to be a top-end playmaker, but he's also a very good defensive forward, who has often been one of his team's top penalty killers. he skates very well with an explosive first few steps and a smooth glide you don't see often with bigger players. he projects as a potential no. 1 star is a very strong skater with excellent strength and power in his stride and the ability to beat anyone he faces. he reaches top-speed quickly and is very agile and elusive. he is balanced on his edges and possesses immense strength on his skates and the ability to control the puck against pressure. is not a flashy guy, but instead he beats players with his power, reach and quickness. he dodges players with smooth moves and he uses his strength to power his way past players, transporting the puck around the zone with him as he analyzes his playmaking options. he finds his options quickly and shows off his high hockey iq and ability to create offense by setting players up with crisp, creative feeds that break down the defense. also possesses a powerful shot that he likes to get off from the high-slot. he uses his power and instincts to get into position and then rifle one off at the net. he has a rising shot and it causes real problems for goaltenders with the velocity and power behind his release. strength and power on the boards helps him earn possession in battles; winning puck possession and maintaining control under pressure. he uses his strength well to gain position and get his chances off. he is hard to knock off the puck, and when he combines his speed, skill and strength, he is very hard to contain and he becomes the best player on the ice. doesn't lack effort on defense either, as he plays his normal high-compete game and he gives consistent efforts at both ends. he plays hard and supports the defense well down-low and in the slot area. he is an efficient penalty-killer, playing an aggressive style, pressuring the point and causing changes of possession at the blue line. again, there is a lot to like about a projected franchise in the making, but if there was one area we feel he can improve, it is his game-to-game and shift-to-shift consistency. there were games this season when it seemed he was just mailing it in. mind you most of those came when he had already contributed on the score sheet and the victory was not in question, but at the nhl level–and if that is where he wants to play next season–he will not get away with coasting through the last 20 minutes of play.\n",

            "is a very skilled and advanced defenseman who has shown a strong commitment to north america, having played on this side of the atlantic for the past four seasons. he's a very gifted skater with good agility and power out of his stride. mechanically, he isn't perfect -- he has an awkward lean-over skating style -- but the end result looks promising, with room to improve. he's above average as an offensive player, with good puck skills and great ability to find lanes and move the puck. he's slightly undersized for a defenseman, but he's decent-to-solid in his own end, with good angles, positioning and stick work. there are times when his defensive zone play shows a read error, but overall, he makes enough stops to be reliable at even strength. is a smooth-skating, highly intelligent blueliner. he has great composure in all zones and all situations. he never looks panicked. he shows that composure off by taking the puck in his own zone, methodically escaping the forecheck before wiring a crisp outlet pass onto the tape of the forward breaking out of the zone. he does this consistently and effortlessly. he really has a lot of whip in his stick when he passes, and executes outlets in a flawless fashion. he shows off a nice low, hard, accurate wrist shot from the point on the powerplay or his fantastic slapshot off the one-timer. he can absolutely wire the puck with a shooting technique that is mature from top to bottom as he is projected to be a threat at the nhl level as both a pp passer and point shooter. his composure also comes into play in the offensive zone; either by making a really nice spin move when faced with pressure or just making the simple dump where a teammate can retrieve it. likes to carry the puck through the neutral zone with a heads up style of play, holding off attacking sticks while still drawing in defenders before making plays. he displays a strong sense of positioning and decision making regarding when to join the rush. on the defensive side of the puck he also shows well by displaying elite hockey sense. he reads the play exceptionally well and knows his coverage assignment. makes smooth plays to neutralize the attack and smart reads. he uses his edges and solid footwork to maintain a tight gap as he skates backwards over the red line. he uses his stick to steer the attacker to the boards, making one quick hop to the before poking the puck away and guiding the attacking player into the wall. his plays both offensively and defensively are all done in such a fluid motion and in such quick succession that he really makes it look easy. is also very clever in using his 200-pound frame. he can throw a surprising and punishing check, and he seems to always engage using his thick body a split second before the opposing checker, gaining inside position on the puck. what do you say about a draft eligible defenseman that brings back flashes of doug harvey and his calm calculated demeanour, skating the puck up ice before bursting a pass through a seam? or of how niklas lidstrom used to defend the rush by angling guys off and quickly turning the play back up ice. the obvious factor that has been mitigated somewhat by his desire over the past couple seasons to play in north america and the current economy. but some nhl teams are still apprehensive to spend a high value asset.\n",

            "was incredible this season, and was arguably best defenseman despite being 17 years old. \"he's smooth as silk\" said one scout; with another saying \"he makes everything look easy.\" his skating won't blow you away, but he's certainly above average, with power out of his first step, good edges and footwork. is at the top of his game when he has the puck, whether it's on an outlet, bringing it up on the rush or controlling a power play. he makes a ton of plays offensively and never looks panicked when doing so. he's pretty developed physically already, measuring in at 6-2 and 214 pounds, although he's not a very physical player. his defense isn't poor, in fact i'd say it's better than average, but he can get caught making mistakes in his positional play. he's a potential top-four d-man, who can also be a first-unit power-play option. really impresses as a smooth, puck-moving defenseman who is responsible defensively and has the raw offensive instincts to quarterback a potent powerplay. is a strong skater who moves fluidly with his high-end mobility and agility with and without the puck. his short passes and long range passes both hit their marks. he makes such smooth passes on the breakout it almost looks effortless, which makes it all the better as he kick starts the rush. very strong reads of the game and his reactions tend to be the most appropriate for the situation he finds himself in. confidence radiates from him when he has the puck and it makes his teammates calm and feel comfortable with him leading the charge, even as the youngest member on the team. is a cerebral defender with an impactful first pass that enables the forwards to get a head start on gaining the zone and creating some offense. he will carry the puck up on his own and gain the zone, but he dissects all options before deciding. maintains a good handle on the puck and poise when pressured and still manages to get a perfect pass off. on the powerplay, is very active and is constantly moving to open ice to help give his teammates an open pass. makes the smart play with excellent lateral movement to keep the puck in at the point. his shot packs a punch from the point. it is an absolute cannon and he does a great job getting it through traffic in front. plays the one-on-one well and uses his stick to poke the puck off the opponent's stick before taking a quick step forward to retrieve it and move it back up ice. his game is mature beyond his years and he has the potential to be an impact player at the nhl level as soon as next season. a lack of overall consistency is an area that will need to improve. he puts forward many impactful shifts every game, but he can also go invisible for long stretches as well. another area where he sometimes gets himself in trouble is with his shot hitting shin pads of forwards pressuring him hard at the point. fortunately, sometimes he reads that and makes the smart play to go d-to-d or gets the puck deep to avoid that trouble. the area that needs the most work, though, is his defensive game. he runs around a bit in the defensive zone and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to give him any real pk time. essentially, it comes down to him developing the mindset of having to play consistent defense to realize his full potential.\n",

            "had a pretty successful second season in north america, racking up a lot of points in halifax. he's a versatile forward in that he can play and the and can play on both special teams. has a pro-sized frame, skates and handles the puck at above-average levels and can play with pace. his ability to play either a speed, skill or power game makes him very appealing, especially since he shows a commitment to get back into the defensive zone. scouts have noted that he can get tunnel vision with the puck at times, and overall he's not a true standout offensive talent. but he does a lot well and has a fair amount of nhl potential. makes good decisions with and without the puck and plays his position very well. his line dominated in the offensive zone all season and was leaned on quite a bit in halifax this season. we like strength. he has a very hard, pro-ready shot, a long reach and isn't afraid to go to the dirty areas. has a hop in his step and has good, quick acceleration that allows him to scoot past defenders and beat them to pucks. skating is a tad choppy at full speed but he is well balanced and has above average mobility. good quick release on his wrist shots, often fooling goalies due to the speed on the release as he forces them to make a save. he's a high-flying winger who exudes confidence with the puck, possessing quick hands and the ability to stickhandle in tight quarters. passes are so smooth they look to be going in slow motion. sees passing lanes well and adjusts his positioning to hit them with perfection. good on zone entries as he looks for options with speed or slows up to a stop inside the blue line to move the puck. he will grind it out in the corner to retrieve the puck and seems to always want possession, thriving when he is in control of the game. has the instinct to know when his teammate is going to get a shot off, and reacts by driving to the net to get any possible rebound. will take a hit to make a play and uses his strength effectively on the wall. separates himself from opponents with his burst and his size, but isn't one to lay a huge hit on the wall or in open ice. makes the decisions in the offensive zone, even when being extremely pressured; does this with poise and patience as he dishes the puck or protects it until he creates an option or one presents itself. absolutely a guy who was trending upwards as the season progressed. defensive play is not an area that would be considered a plus; although, he does know what and when to make a play in his own zone. the drive to do it is the issue. his conditioning is definitely a question mark as well. he seemed to wear down at points in the season. we are not convinced he is a highend guy we can see leading a team offensively at the next level, but instead, more of a strong complimentary player who can keep up to the most skilled and flashy playmakers or plug into a third line role if needed. there were game reports this season with the notes “inconsistent compete level” that might make an nhl team think twice about taking him too early. not going to be a consistent physical guy or a beast to play against on the wall. his strength and size should only be seen as a potential asset.\n",

            "the czech native was very good in his rookie q season after crossing the pond. he played all situations for the sea dogs and got better as the season went along. has a pretty well-rounded style but doesn't have one particular elite skill. \"he's a great skater who carries the puck well,\" one nhl scout said, while another stated, \"he's got a great physical game and can make plays in his own end.\" his footwork is very clean, with an easy stride and the power to get up in the rush. doesn't have standout puck skills, but he's a very calm and efficient passer who makes plays when under pressure. he uses his frame well to win battles and box out forwards and still has room to fill out. defensively, he shows solid value. his positioning and reads aren't perfectly tweaked yet, as i've seen him get beat a little too much, but he makes stops and can kill penalties at a fine level. is a silky smooth defender with an elite understanding of where the play is headed. amazing feet and constantly makes high-end reads on the breakout. he plays a pretty complete game, but primarily relies on his footwork to get the job done. he has nice speed in open ice and has the ability to make the other team miss with some fancy footwork and head fakes. his skating is also key in races to loose pucks and catching forwards. it takes him very few steps to catch up to opposing forwards or make it to a loose puck first. cannot be pressured by forecheckers as he can simply skate himself out of danger with his great feet. he also has an absolute cannon from the point, and what really makes him dangerous is that he gets it off in no time. he makes the decision very quickly to shoot the puck or make another play, either way, the puck is not on his stick for very long. it's pretty accurate and it's as hard as they come. has great vision and is also a solid carrier of the puck. joins the rush pretty often. defensively, he doesn't like to initiate and uses his stick more consistently than his body. but when he does use his physical side he is very dangerous and extremely tough to play against. he is a bit of a sleeping bear as he picks up the physical game and edge when someone pisses him off in front of the net or after the whistle. when he plays with that edge opponents need to watch out as he will line them up and try to take their heads off with a big devastating check. he also does not telegraph when he is coming, which makes him scary. not afraid to push, shove, face-wash or even apply a little slash to an opponents calf in a scrum. his defensive reads are solid and he knows who to cover. good on penalty kill, but not great. plays smart hockey, and learns from his mistakes. a lack of consistency is the largest negative we can find with him as he can have a real impact one shift and then look like a total passenger the next five shifts. he will have a shift where he is hard to play against, making a strong physical play and transitioning the puck quickly, but then the next he is faced with a similar situation he looks soft, just waving his stick at them and unwilling to make the hard physical play. this inconsistency carries over to his passing game as well as he can be pin point accurate and then suffer bouts of throwing passes a good five feet in front of his streaking forwards or into their feet.\n",

            "after coming in to his draft season as a top-15 prospect, season didn't unfold quite as well as he'd have liked because of several ailments, but he still managed to pull off a fine campaign. standout attribute is his hockey sense. \"he has so many little details to his game\" said one scout, \"he makes smart plays all over the ice.\" is a smooth, quiet player that gets a lot done. he sees the ice at a high level, he's creative, but isn't overly flashy with the puck, and rarely makes mistakes. is very good defensively, often being the kind of player who is leaned on to kill penalties and take critical defensive zone draws. his skating is what one scout describes as \"deceptively quick,\" in that he won't jet down the but he can get to a good top gear and doesn't labor around the ice. the commit is a strong two-way player who does many of the little things a team needs to be a winner. he is a strong and talented who relishes playing a 200-foot game. is a dynamic skater who is strong laterally and can start and stop on a dime. his powerful first steps give him the ability to gain an advantage on his opponents in foot races. he uses his incredible straight line speed to blow by defenders on the outside and push the pace, opening up lanes with the puck on his stick by drawing defensemen in close. a smooth operator in the offensive zone and with the puck on his stick. he surveys the ice for options before dialing up a skilled pass to a streaking teammate. quick, smart and smooth is his game. loves to pass the puck and help set up solid attempts, but will not turn down an opportunity to fire off a shot himself. has a strong shot with quick release, but it is his instincts of where to get to that make him a dangerous scorer. doesn't flash with a bevy of creative tricks when he has the puck; he simply holds it, protecting it and keeping it until he finds an option. a very patient player who is an opportunistic offensive threat. has a nose for the net and is great at timing arriving pucks and getting off a quickly released one-timer. plays all situations. uses an active mind and well developed defensive tools to get a jump to disrupt the play and cause a turnover. he is relied on in key situations and important face-offs, winning most of his draws. he gets down low in the face-off circle, getting his stick parallel to the ice and using his quick reaction time and strength to win the draw cleanly. does the little things he is strong on the wall and fights for the puck hard. he is a safe bet to support his defense and dig in along the boards consistently or if he thinks his teammate has the upper hand he will support just outside of the scrum, awaiting the loose puck. has leadership qualities oozing out of him and was the captain of the u18's this past season. there is not a lot to pick apart with regards to game but one thing nhl teams will likely be thinking is that his upside and offensive ability is not that high. he is also not overly large even though he has demonstrated he is strong for his size. he also has a bit of an injury/illness history the past two seasons that leave a few question marks as to if he will be able to fully withstand the rigors of the nhl life. some further time in will do wonders for him.\n",

            "is a great power winger who showed flashes in the this season on top of quality under-18 showings. he's one of the better skaters available, with the first-few-step acceleration and overall top gear to simply fly through the neutral zone and pressure defenders. when you combine speed with a strong frame and a willingness to attack the net, he becomes a dangerous physical threat. his hand-eye coordination allows him to control the puck well and be dangerous getting his stick on pucks in front of the net. can play somewhat effectively, in addition to his natural slot. he needs to improve his pace and reads, as he can get a little lost in the play at times. is a strong, two-way forward who brings to the table an impressive balance between skill and physicality. he's got both and uses both properly. he is a very fast skater and has quick acceleration. is a smooth, powerful-looking skater who gains power and speed coming down the he has excellent size and strength, and is very strong on the puck. i was really impressed with the way used his speed to escape players and take the puck down the outside, and then use his body to protect the puck effectively from defenders. is smart with the puck and sees the ice well. he displayed decent hand speed and creativity. he distributes it into open seams, and is a quick thinker with the puck. he makes a crisp, effective pass and locates holes in the opposing defense quickly. also has a quick, hard wrist shot that he'll use coming off the he works hard on the walls and competes endlessly for the puck. uses his size nicely to battle for pucks and doesn't seem to mind the physical game. he is solid defensively, getting back into the play quickly and working to take chances from the point men. gets into post-whistle altercations, especially if provoked and during emotional games. outstanding penalty killer. knows how to force a turnover. a leader and a real handful to deal with. hits everything in sight and happily initiates contact. not one you look forward to seeing in the corners if you are a defenseman. he is tenacious on the penalty kill, using his stick and smarts to close off options. he gets his frame in front of shots and in lanes defensively to disrupt the opposition. does not possess high-end creativity or elite offensive vision that would make you think he will be a big point producer at the nhl level. while he can both score and set up a play for a teammate, he needs to work on both his shot and passing skills as both can be hit or miss (pun intended). seen by most as a very effective complementary player and not a frst-line contributor at the next level. should work on discipline and skating away from altercations. can put his team down a man when he lets his emotions get the best of him.\n",

            "he is strong in puck possession, can make quick decisions with the puck, and works hard to get to the net and win battles. scouts describe him as a very dangerous player from the hashmarks in. skating needs some work, as his first few steps aren't the best. he's improved a fair amount defensively and has become a fine penalty killer. quenneville is a big-bodied forward with strong shoulders. he is not the fastest skater in the league, but he defnitely has some good quickness in tight to go along with a technically sound stride. flipped between and the this season, but overall, we liked his defensive commitment and positioning in both roles. shows some solid backcheck pressure and is physically involved in the corners. shows very good work along the walls using his strength and hockey sense. always seems to end up on the winning end of puck battles and cycle confrontations. his cycle work is very strong, using a combination of his feet and good puck skills to maintain possession while looking for options. shows a good, hard shot, and pretty good release with solid velocity and accuracy. we would like to see a little more offensive creativity. a pro-style forward who has a physical element to his game, a good shot, and who works hard in all three zones.\n",

            "he's a very strong winger who is physical and intense every shift. is an above-average skater, although i've gotten mixed reviews from scouts on that area of his game. some scouts i've talked to note they aren't crazy about his skating, but every time i've seen him he's looked impressive in that area. has good balance and is effective protecting the puck. he isn't an overly skilled player, but he's decent offensively with good instincts. on his best shifts, his hockey iq shines through, but needs to work on reigning in his emotions and not taking bad penalties, which he does often. the apple didn't fall far from the tree on that front. he has the ability to be a scoring, physical winger if he pans out. is a solid skater, but it takes him a few strides to get up to speed. he works hard and what he lacks in speed, he makes up for in size and determination. he has the ability to pull away from players when in possession of the puck and is very agile. he pivots well, and is powerful in stops and starts. he dishes accurate, crisp passes and has good hands. he controls the puck with ease and the timing of his passes are near perfect. has a very effective shot that he can get off in tight spaces. he uses his size to protect the puck well, and does not back down from a fght. he is a hard-nosed player who fnds a way to always get to the net. maturity is almost there but, at times loses his cool and doesn't focus on the play at hand. he plays with an edge and is a real agitator, which can be costly at times. he is solid, allowing him to take hits along the wall. even after a long shift, he does not quit and drives the net for scoring chances. he is one of the frst back on the backcheck and his puck possession is incredible. he plays in all situations and delivers monstrous checks when the time is covers his check in the defensive zone well and is great at removing players from the puck.\n",

            "has been on the prospect radar for several years. he was a top scorer at last year's under-18 championships, was the top overall pick in the import draft and received a lot of praise from scouts before he transferred. he's the kind of player who can be set up on the point on a power play, due to the way he can control the puck and see all the options. what makes dangerous at even strength is his skill level, but also his intangibles. he's a very hard worker who is plays with a physical edge and can land some crushing blows. he's committed defensively with fine skills on the penalty kill. he needs to get stronger and be a little more consistent offensively, but there aren't a ton of nits to pick with . is a very intriguing prospect who displays a very complete offensive game, combining size with skill and intelligence to make him a threat each time he has possession of the puck in the offensive zone. he is also a responsible defensive player whose compete level is very high. moves very well on the ice, especially for someone of his size and strength. his stride is very effective and he does seem to have a fairly speedy top gear once he gets moving. his balance is impressive and combined with his size, he is diffcult to separate from the puck when in possession. shows excellent poise with the puck. patience combined with confdence makes him a threat to be dangerous with the puck in the offensive zone. he does not frequently use diffcult moves and dekes, but rather uses his reach and body positioning to make it diffcult for defenders trying to get the puck from him. he has excellent pass-receiving abilities both on his forehand and backhand, and displays a soft touch while handling the puck. likes to get the puck on net and see where things go from there, an instinct that should transition well to higher levels of play. multiple times a game, he throws it on net from unlikely angles in the hopes of generating rebounds in traffc. good instincts and hockey sense. his wrist shot has a quick release, strong accuracy and solid power behind it. he has a solid frame and good balance on his skates. finishes his checks well. he is not afraid to engage in physical play whatsoever and often benefts when the game is more physical due to his preferred style. he is able to use his size very effciently to protect the puck. a smart player who rarely makes a bad pass, passes are often on the tape with good velocity, and he can move the puck very quickly upon receiving it. he is relied upon in all situations and shows excellent work ethic each time he is on the ice. he plays well in all three zones and is capable of playing whatever style of play the game requires. isn't the most electrifying player and will not get you out of your seat with fashy moves or plays often, but where he lacks elite-level skills, he makes up for in his versatility and often with his drive. acceleration is not a damning weakness per se, but it is defnitely something he will need to continue to work on in order to keep up in the professional game. with added strength, his frst few steps will get more powerful and quicker. like most kids his age, he also suffers bouts of inconsistent play and lacking effort away from the puck. with that said, when he is on his game, there are few better scrappy, two-way prospects in this draft. he can cross the line of aggressive and dirty with some of his physical play and gets himself and his team into trouble.\n",

            "had one of the best starts to an career i can remember for a goalie in terms of performance. he essentially has every tool except for size (6-0, 183 pounds). his athleticism is top-end; his quickness, side-to-side movements and reflexes allow him to make a lot of tough stops other goalies don't make. while he has those dynamic qualities, he remains effective in net in terms of reads and patience with his depth. he battles well on loose pucks, and gives good second efforts. his main weakness is that due to his size, he appears to lose the puck in traffic and be prone to the odd soft goal here and there that goes high on him. he also can be a little too kick-happy, leading to big rebounds. an athletic, but “small” stopper based on today's goaltender size standards, nevertheless just stops pucks. has impressive refexes and quickness that can't be taught. he moves along the goal line very well, and never loses track of the play. has good hands as well, using both his blocker and glove to make saves on shots marked for the corners. his quickness and ability to recover is impressive, and he is solid positionally and shows great composure. very effective puck handler as well, keeping the play moving and even setting up a few decent breakouts for his team each game. he was good on his rebound control and his ability to see through traffc to make the frst save almost automatic. poised and mature beyond his years, a calming infuence on the team in front of him. never gives up and battles until the puck is covered, cleared or it gets by him. one issue to improve upon is his positioning as he can get caught sitting too far back in his crease, leaving a lot of room that nhl shooters will have no problem hitting.\n",
