I’m not talking about him compared to other prospects in this draft. I’m talking nobody. As in, you could put him on the ice with the world’s best shooters and they wouldn’t be able to load up just off of their lead skate and fire it off balance like he does, or drop it into their feet and let it go like he does. He’s got one of the best shooting actions in motion I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe way the puck explodes off of his blade almost without any forward motion to indicate the shot’s coming is remarkable. While that bent-sideways cannon that he has off of his right hip is his defining quality, it’s not the only tool he has that is singular, either. In fact, it’s not even the only element of his shooting arsenal that is one of one. His release is lightning-quick. There’s the pinpoint accuracy from impossible angles. There are the little delays and stutters he uses to create separation and get to his spots. There’s his variety of shooting stances (right down to his curl-and-drag, his one-timer, and his feel off of his backhand).\r\n\r\nHe’s got everything else you look for in a dynamic play creator as well. He’s got unbelievably quick hands and the loose grip that all great handlers have. He’s got high-end speed with his galloping crossover strides and strong acceleration from a standstill, which help him carry the puck up the ice, create one-on-one off the rush, or join in transition as the trailer whenever he has to play catchup.\r\n\r\nHe’s also highly creative despite his goal-scoring tilt. Even though the goalie is his focus, I wouldn’t say he tunnel-visions, and there’s a lot to his game between the offensive-zone blue line and the shot he takes that’s inventive. He has also learned to use the attention his shot gets as a tool to open up his passing game and find linemates at the backdoor with blind passes through seams. He regularly makes difficult plays as a passer, demonstrating high-end spatial awareness and often finding second or even third options (constantly pre-scanning and shoulder-checking). He’s an entry machine driving play through the neutral zone and across the line in control. He goes to the front of the net and will bail out to make effort plays. Add in instincts off the puck to get open even when he’s a marked man, an improved physical engagement (he’s really quite feisty and competitive), some underrated skill as a puck thief, a strong lower half, and you’ve got a superstar prospect. Nobody can defend his inside-out cut into that low, hard wrister of his at the junior level. It often takes two to take the puck off of him when he’s twisting and turning, too.\r\n\r\nHe’s a marvel, with legit 50-goal upside at the next level. I think he’ll stick at centre, too (it was nice to see him at 53.6 percent in the circle this year). I’m not sure there has ever been a player Connor Bedard’s age in the history of hockey who has been able to shoot the puck like he can. He can get a little ahead of the play, and he’s got work to do on his game defensively if he doesn’t want to get hemmed in at the next level, but those are things you live with when it comes to talent as singular as his.","count":1},{"name":"Fantilli is a big, strong, powerful center who takes pucks from the wall to the interior with force, ease and speed — the kind of player every team covets. He can beat you along the wall on the cycle. He can beat you carrying the puck in rotations around the perimeter of the offensive zone. He can beat you by pushing through lanes to the middle third, driving the net, or dropping a shoulder to take space that isn’t there. He can beat you flying out wide. He has regularly blown me away in viewings these last couple of years (at Hockey Canada’s showcase two summers ago, in games where he looked like a man among boys in the USHL, and again at various points throughout his historic, Hobey Baker-winning freshman year at Michigan).\r\n\r\nAnd even at 6-foot-2 and about 195 pounds, he’s one of the best skaters in this draft. It’s not often we see players his size who can move like him. His skating is balanced. It’s powerful when it needs to be and light and adjustable when it needs to be. Within his movement patterns, he can handle the puck on a string and shade opposing defenders off his hip. He’s going to be a transition monster. On top of it all, he’s physical, he’s a fiery competitor, he’ll get after it on forecheck and track pucks, he plays with energy, and he’ll pounce on turnovers and be opportunistic. He can score from midrange consistently with his low-kick wrister and one-timer, he’s got an ability to protect the puck in and out of coverage, he’s got a dangerous curl-and-drag wrister, and he’s comfortable in traffic. When he’s on, he can completely take over a game.\r\n\r\nHe also shed some of the force-it plays this year that could frustrate me and others at lower levels (he made better decisions on shot selection, overhandled less, and utilized his linemates better). I think he’s going to play in the NHL next year and be successful on raw ability from the jump. And I wasn’t deterred from that belief by his low point totals at men’s worlds.

He’s most dangerous around the net and he gets there with regularity. His ability to drive to the middle of the ice may be one of his biggest separating factors among other centers in this class.

He has regularly blown me away in viewings these last couple of years (at Hockey Canada’s showcase two summers ago, in games where he looked like a man among boys in the USHL, and again at various points throughout his historic, Hobey Baker-winning freshman year at Michigan).\r\n\r\nAnd even at 6-foot-2 and about 195 pounds, he’s one of the best skaters in this draft. It’s not often we see players his size who can move like him. His skating is balanced. It’s powerful when it needs to be and light and adjustable when it needs to be. Within…","Description - Smaht Scouting":"Adam Fantilli has every tool that an NHL team would dream of having with their top overall selection. He’s got the physical tools of size, strength, speed and lateral mobility. He has amazing puck skill with the ability to do it at full speed and in small area situations. He can protect the puck, put his shoulder down and power through a defender, or put it under a defender’s stick and put them through the spin cycle.\r\n\r\nHis vision is high-end with the ability to find lateral teammates and move defenders out of passing lanes to open up new scoring opportunities. He has a heavy wrist shot and a dynamite one-timer.  The power play could run through Fantilli or he could be the trigger man. ","Description - ESPN (Chris Peters)":"A 6-foot-2, 200-pound power center with touch, Fantilli is the kind of player teams are desperate for–skilled size. While the league continues to go more towards skill, players that have size, strength, physicality and speed will always get longer looks than their smaller counterparts. In Fantilli’s case, he’s also one of the best offensive performers in this draft class.\r\n\r\nWith powerful, quick skating, Fantilli gets up and down the ice as well as anyone. He’s hard to move off pucks and difficult to slow down in transition. If you time your check right, you have to hope he’s not going to bowl you over. There’s an aggressiveness and tenacity in Fantilli’s game that can overpower the opposition and lead to him winning a lot of battles and one-on-one plays. He’s most dangerous around the net and he gets there with regularity. His ability to drive to the middle of the ice may be one of his biggest separating factors among other centers in this class. Meanwhile, he’s producing at a near h…","Description - EP Rinkside":"nan","Description - EP Rinkside Part 2":"A fantastic consolation prize, Adam Fantilli would be the first overall selection in many years. A power centre with the ability to score from distance, matchup against skill, and drive play into the middle of the ice. Plus, he’s a serious weapon on the man advantage. This is a draft-and-play asset.","Description - The Painted Lines":"nan","Description - FCHockey":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":1},{"Year":2023,"Position":"RW","Height":70,"Weight":148,"Drafted":"nan","Team":"nan","Average Ranking":3,"Name":"Matvei Michkov","Description - Corey Pronman":"Michkov is one of the very best first-year draft eligibles I've ever seen from inside the offensive blue line. He has truly special offensive skill and hockey sense. His mind operates differently from other players in how he sees the play develop and he always seems to find ways to figure into scoring chances despite not being the biggest or fastest. His mind is special, but he's freakishly skilled with the puck too, and can make elite stickhandling plays seem routine. He can make plays at a high level, but Michkov is a finisher who will score a lot of goals as a pro. His skating is more elusive than fast and I wouldn't call him a high-compete type either. He’s signed in the KHL through the 2025-26 season, but he projects as a game-breaking elite scoring winger in the NHL.","Description - Scott Wheeler":"Michkov is the best Russian prospect since Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin back in 2004. On talent, upside and pedigree, his game checks all three boxes. The combination of Michkov’s position (NHL teams definitely think twice when drafting wingers this high) and the increasing uncertainty around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and his contract in the KHL with SKA could complicate where he goes on draft day, but he still belongs here. And despite suffering a lower-body injury in a KHL preseason game, Michkov (who played to a goal a game last year in the MHL) played to a goal a game in Russia’s second-tier VHL and was extremely productive for his age after the move to Sochi in the KHL (he actually led a lowly Sochi team in scoring in his time there).\r\n\r\nIf he were a little more committed off the puck (which I’m not as critical of as some others), and an inch or two taller, he’d have a near-perfect profile for me. He’s different than Bedard in tools and approach. Michkov’s brilliance comes …","Description - Smaht Scouting":"A smart, dynamic goal-scoring winger, Michkov dictates play when he’s on the ice. With constant delays and changes of pace, baiting poke-checks to freeze defenders just enough to get by them, making up for his lack of a high-end top speed. Making give-and-go plays all along the ice, using his teammates effectively, he’s not afraid to turn back in transition in order to maintain possession and open up new opportunities. He finds open ice extremely well and always positions himself to be a great passing option in the offensive zone. All this is designed with the end goal of creating space for himself in dangerous areas to let his lethal shot fly. He may look small, but he’s not easily knocked over, and he doesn’t shy away from physical battles; his physical game has improved a lot over the course of the season as he’s gotten stronger, and it should improve even more from here. There are flashes of great playmaking ability, but it’s not consistent; his ideas and vision are great, but the…","Description - ESPN (Chris Peters)":"For the last few years, I’ve described Michkov as a genius-level hockey player. His sense for the game is among the best I’ve seen since I’ve been evaluating prospects. Bedard might be the best goal scorer, but Michkov is not terribly far behind. What makes Michkov special is that he’s always thinking a step ahead. He uses his creativity to find space, but just about everything he does is intentional and net-driven. The quickness with which he figures out how he needs to get open or how he can best position a shot is at an elite level. In addition to processing the game at such a high rate, Michkov also has the hands, and the shot, to execute with precision.\r\n\r\nCurrently playing in Russia’s second pro division, Michkov is averaging a goal per game. For as good a player as he is, he still lacks the strength and quickness to be as effective at the KHL level as everywhere else he’s been. That will come eventually, though, as he gets stronger. This is also what makes his hockey sense spec…","Description - EP Rinkside":"nan","Description - EP Rinkside Part 2":"Statistically, Matvei Michkov is *another* first overall level prospect. The manner in which he produced in the KHL this season is the stuff of legend. A shooter who has never met a puck or a situation that he didn’t lean into. He’s developed a highly advanced playmaking arsenal as well. The 5-foot-11 winger’s biggest knock is his birth certificate and contract status. His offensive upside is second only to Bedard.","Description - The Painted Lines":"nan","Description - FCHockey":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":2},{"Year":2023,"Position":"C","Height":75,"Weight":194,"Drafted":"nan","Team":"nan","Average Ranking":4,"Name":"Leo Carlsson","Description - Corey Pronman":"Carlsson has elite skill, which when combined with his frame and a strong motor, has allowed him to be a very good player in a great league as a draft eligible. Carlsson routinely shows the ability to beat pro defenders with skill. He gets a ton of chances in the high-percentage areas, both due to his hands and his willingness to attack the net. He's an excellent playmaker as well with a very imaginative offensive mind who can run a pro power play and often played the flank in the SHL on the man advantage. His only drawback is a lack of true separation speed. I've seen worse feet on a 6-foot-3 guy, but he won't be turning NHL defensemen around. He's mostly played wing the last two years but has enough experience at center and the traits to play the middle that I could see him become a legit No. 1 center in the NHL with star upside.","Description - Scott Wheeler":"Though he doesn’t play the game with some of the shine of the three players in front of him, Carlsson had a tremendous age-adjusted season between his play with Orebro in the SHL (including in the playoffs), at the world juniors (where he was one of Sweden’s top forwards despite playing sick/banged up), and then for the senior men’s national team for the first time (a team he is now the youngest player to ever score for), even considering his December 2004 birthday. This all came a year after playing to virtually two points per game at the J20 level (he looked good in an important role as a top-nine centre for Sweden at U18 worlds before an injury kept him out of their medal-round run to a gold medal, too).\r\n\r\nCarlsson’s a big kid who has begun to come into his body (he’s 6-foot-3 and 198 pounds), but he’s also got slick handling and finesse for a forward his size, regularly finding his way through traffic or around it by out-waiting defenders one-on-one in shielded puck protection of…","Description - Smaht Scouting":"Carlsson has been played extremely well at the SHL level this season for Örebro. In the offensive zone, he will take over the cycle and will move laterally quickly to shift away from pressure as he sees that if he moves laterally he will skate into a quality passing lane that he can exploit. Carlsson’s vision and stick-handling can get him out of well-pressured jams in all three zones. He will find quality passing lanes in the neutral zone when looking for a teammate in stride to pass to and has no issue with maneuvering the puck around tight pressure. Carlsson hunts for loose pucks with speed and has the physicality to deliver quality checks along the boards to cause puck disruption in tight board battles. Carlsson is a prospect that we see being a reliable playmaker and playing in a line one role at the NHL level. ","Description - ESPN (Chris Peters)":"The buzz is growing (and rightfully so) that Carlsson belongs in the top-tier of this draft, or at least deserves to be spoken in the same sentence as Bedard, Michkov and Fantilli. Carlsson has all of the measurable qualities teams look for in a power forward, but he’s shown very early on in this SHL season that he’s got the game to go along with it. He’s been scoring at an extraordinarily high-rate for a U19 player in Sweden’s top pro league, while averaging top-six minutes and showing an ability to drive play.\r\n\r\nAt 6-foot-3, 194, he’s a solidly-built forward who is difficult to move off pucks and has good net-drive ability. Carlsson also has soft-touch skills with the puck and makes confident decisions when he has it on his stick. Off the puck, he competes and is responsible at both ends of the ice. He might not have the outright offensive creativity of the three players ahead of him, but he has good hands and good touch on the puck, which makes him extra dangerous in tight.","Description - EP Rinkside":"nan","Description - EP Rinkside Part 2":"Oh, look, another first-overall talent. Leo Carlsson shone brightly against the best professionals in Sweden. The 6-foot-3 centre boasts all of the traits you look for in a front-line pivot. Won’t wow you constantly, but does everything very well. Big, strong, quick, skilled. We like him a lot.","Description - The Painted Lines":"nan","Description - FCHockey":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":3},{"Year":2023,"Position":"LW","Height":69.75,"Weight":170,"Drafted":"nan","Team":"nan","Average Ranking":5,"Name":"Zach Benson","Description - Corey Pronman":"Benson has a ton of creativity and offense in his game. He makes high-end skill plays routinely, he's one of the better passers in junior and projects to be a major asset on an NHL power play. Benson lacks ideal size at 5-foot-9, but he's relentless in puck battles often coming out with the puck despite his frame. He's a responsible, detailed defensive player who is an asset without the puck. His frame, combined with a lack of separation speed, is a concern, though, for his NHL projection even though he's got good quickness in tight. There is a fair amount of risk on his projection, but his strong compete and tremendous skill plus track record of scoring, makes you think there is still a very good chance he can become a quality top-six wing in the NHL.","Description - Scott Wheeler":"There were a lot of nights last season, on an Ice team that boasted half a dozen of the better forwards and two of the top defencemen in the WHL, where this kid was the best player on the ice (which included him leading them in scoring in the playoffs with 23 points in 15 games) as a 16-year-old. And this season there’s no doubt: Though an injury kept him out of the first round of the playoffs and allowed teammate Matt Savoie to really take over in the postseason, Benson was the best forward on arguably the CHL’s most talented team at forward this year.\r\n\r\nAnd while he benefits from playing with talented linemates, Benson’s a driver in every sense. He’s a multi-dimensional forward who has quick acceleration, can handle the puck at speed and change tempos in control, can shape play by opening up his hips to go heel-to-heel, thrives in traffic, is a triple shot-deke-pass threat, plays one step ahead of the game in possession, supports the play effectively, problem-solves as well as anyo…","Description - Smaht Scouting":"While I don’t necessarily see Zach Benson reaching the top of the superstar bucket, (Tavares, Kane, Stamkos etc…) I do envision him being a cornerstone piece for the franchise that selects him this June.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of a player comparison, I get drawn to a few different players. From an offensive skills standpoint, I personally see a lot of similar traits to Cole Perfetti. Great vision, feet always moving, and just very technically sound with every movement. Benson has a motor on him though that never stops running. To me, very similar to watching Brayden Point roam around. There just seems to always be a certain intensity when both of them are on the ice and hunting down pucks. Both great at carving out pockets of space, and tremendous at distributing or finishing plays themselves. ","Description - ESPN (Chris Peters)":"An offensive dynamo with deft scoring touch, Benson has been a key player for one of the best teams in all of junior hockey over the last two seasons. Surrounded by talent, Benson continues to stand out as a play-driver with a strong finish. In this draft with a lot of bigger players, Benson stands out in other ways, especially his offensive intelligence and ability to execute consistently. The primary concern about a player of Bensons' size is his skating. It’s fine, but could be better in order to calm some of the concerns about his size. \r\n\r\nWhat alleviates the skating concern for me is how quickly Benson processes the game and his commitment to playing aggressive off the puck and in pursuit. He takes a lot of pucks off opposing players in a given game. That competitive drive that he has on top of the ability to make a ton of plays during a game should allow him to continue to be an impact player as he progresses up the ranks.","Description - EP Rinkside":"nan","Description - EP Rinkside Part 2":"Some people are worried about selecting a 5-9 forward without blazing speed at this juncture of the draft. I’m not one of them. Zach Benson has the highest work rate in the class. He boasts high-end puck skills and a plus-rated release. His playmaking is ultra-supreme. This is a worker bee with first-line skills. Sure, he may have to move to the flank, but we still bet on these types of guys.","Description - The Painted Lines":"nan","Description - FCHockey":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":4}]},"text/plain":"   Year Position  Height  Weight  Drafted Team  Average Ranking  \\\n0  2023        C   69.75   185.0      NaN  NaN              1.0   \n1  2023        C   74.00   187.0      NaN  NaN              2.0   \n2  2023       RW   70.00   148.0      NaN  NaN              3.0   \n3  2023        C   75.00   194.0      NaN  NaN              4.0   \n4  2023       LW   69.75   170.0      NaN  NaN              5.0   \n\n             Name                        Description - Corey Pronman  \\\n0   Connor Bedard  Bedard is a potential franchise-changing No. 1...   \n1   Adam Fantilli  There's so much to love about Fantilli's NHL p...   \n2  Matvei Michkov  Michkov is one of the very best first-year dra...   \n3    Leo Carlsson  Carlsson has elite skill, which when combined ...   \n4     Zach Benson  Benson has a ton of creativity and offense in ...   \n\n                         Description - Scott Wheeler  \\\n0  Bedard’s statistical profile speaks for itself...   \n1  Fantilli is a big, strong, powerful center who...   \n2  Michkov is the best Russian prospect since Ale...   \n3  Though he doesn’t play the game with some of t...   \n4  There were a lot of nights last season, on an ...   \n\n                        Description - Smaht Scouting  \\\n0  Connor Bedard is an extremely gifted generatio...   \n1  Adam Fantilli has every tool that an NHL team ...   \n2  A smart, dynamic goal-scoring winger, Michkov ...   \n3  Carlsson has been played extremely well at the...   \n4  While I don’t necessarily see Zach Benson reac...   \n\n                   Description - ESPN (Chris Peters)  \\\n0  One of the most naturally gifted goal scorers ...   \n1  A 6-foot-2, 200-pound power center with touch,...   \n2  For the last few years, I’ve described Michkov...   \n3  The buzz is growing (and rightfully so) that C...   \n4  An offensive dynamo with deft scoring touch, B...   \n\n  Description - EP Rinkside  \\\n0                       NaN   \n1                       NaN   \n2                       NaN   \n3                       NaN   \n4                       NaN   \n\n                    Description - EP Rinkside Part 2  \\\n0  Connor Bedard is the premier prospect in the w...   \n1  A fantastic consolation prize, Adam Fantilli w...   \n2  Statistically, Matvei Michkov is *another* fir...   \n3  Oh, look, another first-overall talent.
